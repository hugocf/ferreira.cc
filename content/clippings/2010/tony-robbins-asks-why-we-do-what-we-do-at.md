[Tony Robbins asks why we do what we do](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_why_we_do_what_we_do)
(at [TED.com](http://www.ted.com) )

*(funny improv interaction with Al Gore starting at 5:15)*

Bottom line:

> *What are you going to focus on?*
>
> *Right now, you have to decide what you're going to focus on. In this
> second, consciously or unconsciously. The minute you decide to focus
> on something you've got to give it a meaning, and whatever that
> meaning is produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God
> punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice? An
> emotion, then, creates what we're going to do or the action.*

It's not about *resources* , it's about *resourcefulness* , the
**EMOTION** behind.

Shape the **STATE** that you are in: Focus -\> Meaning -\> Emotion -\>
Action
