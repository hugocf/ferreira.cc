> Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act, the way we
> communicate is from the outside in. It's obvious. We go from the
> clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
>
> But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations --- regardless
> of their size, regardless of their industry --- all think, act and
> communicate from the inside out.
>
> People don't buy **what** you do, they buy **why** you do it.

✓ Communicate by saying: why =\> how =\> what

✗ Don't communicate with: what =\> how =\> why
