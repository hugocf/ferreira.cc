> One effect [of all these choices], paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis instead of liberation.


> The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose.


> **The secret to happiness is... low expectations.**



> Why Choice Makes People Miserable:**
**
>
> 1. Regret and anticipated regret
> 2. Opportunity costs
> 3. Escalation of expectations
> 4. Self-blame


i.e.



1.  ... the other stuff could be better
2.  ... what else we are not having
3.  ... with all the options, this ought to be perfect
4.  ...Â it's *my* fault that this is not perfect



> The "Official Dogma"
>
> * Maximize welfare
> * This means maximize freedom
> * This means maximize choice
>
> * More choice means more freedom
> * More freedom means more welfare
>
> * NOT!!


> [The "Official Dogma"] is all false!


> There is no question that some choice is better than none but it doesn't follow from that, that more choice is better than some choice.
