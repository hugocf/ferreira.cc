> If you want other people to think, don't give instructions, give intent.


First:


> "I intend to submerge the ship." **"Very well."**

> The psychological ownership now shifts to them, they need to discover the answer.


Next:


> "I intend to submerge the ship." **"What do you think I'm thinking right now?"**

> "Wondering whether it's safe?" "Bingo! So, convince me it's safe."


Later:


> "I intend to submerge the ship." **"Is it the right thing to do?"**



Key pilars for giving control:


> Technical Competence ("is it safe?")
> Organisational Clarity ("right thing to do?")


The solution:


> Move the authority to where the information is.



-   Better decision (they have the information)
-   Faster decision (no delay)
-   More motivation (feel they matter)
