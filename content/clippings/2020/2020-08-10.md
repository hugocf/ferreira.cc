Hi Kathy, thanks for reaching out. 

Right now the blog is basically frozen (merely static html pages) due to issues with my hosting provider.

I'm hoping to rebuild it over the summer into something I can actually edit and change at will but time to do it is lacking, to be honest.

Cheers

Hello Hugo, 

As a mother, I can totally relate to your comment that hobbies tend to not survive a house full of kids ;) 

I'm reaching out regarding your list of design articles (https://hugo.ferreira.cc/tag/design/) and was wondering if you'd be open to a suggestion. 

We've recently published an article on the difference between UX and UI design (and designers), which is something your readers interested in learning more about these two terms might find helpful. 

I know you're busy, but I would appreciate it if you could take a quick look here: https://www.designerhire.com/ui-ux-designer, and let me know if this is something worth including on your site. 

Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day.

Kathy Cooper, DesignerHire
