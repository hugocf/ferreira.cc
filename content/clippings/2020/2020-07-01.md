Nice summary of a long known description of team’s stages of development.

> The most commonly used framework for a team's stages of development was developed in the mid-1960s by Bruce W. Tuckman. … his descriptions of ***Forming***, ***Storming***, ***Norming*** and ***Performing*** provide a useful framework for looking at your own team.

* TODO: Summarise in a few words the main Feeling, Behaviours, and main Team Tasks of each phase
