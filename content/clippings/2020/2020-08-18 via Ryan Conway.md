Talk introducing the concept of normalization of deviance and the need for pushing through friction in mid-large organisations.


> **How do we fix it?**

>
> Organizations: Short-term discrete fixes
>
> • Document single sources of truth and keep them updated
> • Adopt processes to vet technology decisions (e.g. RFCs)
> • Solicit the WTF of new hires
>
> Organizations: Long-term cultural behaviours changes
>
> • Address hard truths --- kindly
> • Celebrate the glue work (Being Glue --- No Idea Blog)
> • Make psychological safety paramount
>
> Individuals: Goals
>
> • Develop and own your sense of agency
> - Intrinsic Motivation: Automomy, Mastery, and Purpose
> • CAVEAT: being a hero, or an asshole, doesn't scale
>
> Individuals: Strategies
>
> • Have important discussions face-to-face
> • Get to know other people in other teams and in other orgs
> • New idea? Try it once


> While it is true that deviant behaviours normalise over time, **so do constructive behaviours.**

>
> **This is the job.**
