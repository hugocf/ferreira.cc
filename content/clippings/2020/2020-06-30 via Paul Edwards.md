Initiative-based teams issues:

> - Forming, storming, norming, performing
> - Orphaned technology is an operational risk that you don’t know about yet
> - Project-based teams remove agency from the team (and add administrative cost)

Durable teams advantages:

> - A long-lived team can work on bigger opportunities
> - Stable teams can be empowered teams
> - Technical ownership of our estate has already started to save the business money

How to:

> - Handling work that falls across teams
> - Making sure splitting the domain doesn’t limit opportunities
