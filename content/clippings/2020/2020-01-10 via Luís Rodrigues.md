It’s about trade-offs and learning!
nice self-reflection from the author :simple_smile:
gutsy move, open sourcing this :muscle: :clap:

> I think even a peek of the source code will quickly reveal that VVVVVV is not a technically sophisticated game! Even by the standards of self taught indie devs, it’s kind of a mess.

> I dunno, what can I say? I was young and more interested in getting something on the screen than implementing it properly.

> I’ve gained better habits over the past decade, and I’m definitely a better programmer now – but it does seem to take me longer to do things.

Shock treatment: biggest `switch` i’ve ever seen Game.cpp#L622–L4048 😱😁
