> She proposes a solution based on her specialist subject of category theory, which is more interested “in describing things by the role they play in a context, rather than by their intrinsic characteristics”. Mathematically, she says, “if we have two things that are not equal, we could make them equal by making the lesser one greater or by making the greater one less ... However, there is a completely different way we could do it, which is by evaluating the two things on a new dimension entirely.”

_(emphasis added)_
> What she asks us to do is forget ideas of masculine or feminine characteristics, and instead think about types of behaviour that are either “ingressive” or “congressive”. **Ingressive** behaviours are **competitive, adversarial and focused on the self** over the community; **congressive** behaviours are **collaborative, cooperative and focus on society** over the self. It is a frustrating fact, she argues, “that although congressive behaviour is better for society, our society is set up to reward ingressive behaviour”.
