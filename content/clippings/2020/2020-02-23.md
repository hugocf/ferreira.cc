> … some small epiphanies I wrote down during moments of inspiration in my sessions.
> * The energy you put out is the energy you receive
> * Nothing has a meaning apart from the meaning you give to it
> * Progress is power
> * Things don’t change, you have to change
> * Let go and believe
> * Imposter syndrome is just the comfort zone
> * I am not afraid of the storms for I am learning how to sail my ship
> * Give yourself permission
> * Look at your purpose instead of looking at your excuses
> * If you don’t have a plan for your life then someone will make you fit into their plan
> * You won’t achieve your goals by being flexible
> * Results only come from consistency
> * Asking for money is a declaration that I am skilful enough to provide a service
> * It might not be my fault but it is my responsibility to deal with
> * A courageous man dies once, a coward dies a thousand times
> * The bigger your comfort zone, the smaller your life
