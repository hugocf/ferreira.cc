> **[Three paths for a soloist](https://seths.blog/2020/05/three-paths-for-a-soloist/)** by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/about/)

> 1. … Create things you can visualize but haven’t seen yet. Do it without regard for critics, the market or the math of it all. …
> 2. Embrace your market. Make what it needs. … Price it accordingly.
> 3. … Make slightly better than average work, for less than average pricing.

i.e.

1. Make Art
2. Make Painkillers
3. Make Vitamins
