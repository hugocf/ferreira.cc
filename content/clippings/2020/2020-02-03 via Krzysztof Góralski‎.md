> The bi-weekly cycles were meant to prevent over-planning and too frequent changes of requirements. When the delivery process is manual and requires people to spend hands-on time processing tasks, then it is natural to make it as infrequent as possible as well. However, once the first stage, streamlining the flow of the delivery process, is achieved — then doing bi-weekly releases of work makes no sense. It is far better to release more frequently and get much faster feedback from quality assurance and customers regarding the work.
