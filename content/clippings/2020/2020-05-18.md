The key to deliver a good talk? "Preparation, preparation, preparation!!!"


> Hi. How do you prepare your lectures? How many time do you take to prepare?


> On average, the preparation for one lecture is about 40 to 60 hours.
>
> I dry run the lecture in an empty classroom with everything on the blackboard that I am going to write on the blackboard, pretending that there is a full class in front of me, but there is no one. And I talk to them as if there is one. I do that two weeks before the lecture.
>
> In general, the lecture is then a little bit too long. So I have to do some surgery.
>
> Then one week before the lecture, I dry run again. Then I'm very close to the time.
>
> And then 5:00 AM of the morning of the lecture---you can ask my wife---I am at MIT and I give the same lecture dry run for an empty classroom at 5:30 in the morning when the lecture is at 10:00 and the same lecture is at 11:00.
>
> That's the way I prepare.
>
> Don't tell my colleagues, they will hate me.


> By the way, I made an exception for this lecture. I dry run this lecture six times.
