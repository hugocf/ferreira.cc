> It *[DDD]* is not an *architecture* or a *methodology*. It's a more all-round approach with spans in different layers of the socio-technical stack: from reading business needs and organisation constraints, to good coding practices.

> Key traits *[of Domain-Driven Design]*>
> • **Strategy** is embedded in the approach: it's not a one-size fits all recipe.

Focus: Core Domain
Tools: Big Picture EventStorming; Context Mapping

> • **Focus on learning**: it's the major impediment to delivery of high-value software, so let's put it at the centre of our approach.

Goal: Evolutionary Software
Tools: Whirlpool Model; Collaborative modelling (EventStorming, Domain Storytelling, Event Modelling); Collaborative coding (pairing, mobbing)
 
> • **Language(s)** as first class citizens of the software development landscape.

Goal: Ubiquitous Language
Tools: Continuous refactoring

> • **Multiple models** is the key for not evolving into a big ball of mud. 

Focus: Bounded Contexts
Tools: Context Mapping

> • **Sophisticated architectural options** are fundamental. If all you can think of is CRUDs, you'll have a long way to go. *[Vendor independence; Microservices]*

Tools: OO with Domain Events; Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES); Functional Modelling; Actor Model; etc.

> • **Good coding practices** are expected. Evolutionary software without solid testing is suicidal. *[DevOps; BDD]*

Focus: Bounded Contexts
