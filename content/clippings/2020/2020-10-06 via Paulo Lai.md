> For each of the principles, I have “short titles” for them that simplify their intent. These are:
> 
> 1. Business First
> 1. Bottlenecks out
> 1. Learn
> 1. Leadership
> 1. Real Quality
> 1. Product Hypotheses
> 1. Embrace the Fear

> #1 – Our priority is improving the business.
>
> #2 – We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.
>
> #3 – We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and optimize in order to succeed, rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.
>
> #4 – We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture the team towards a more mature quality culture.
>
> #5 – We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product
>
> #6 – We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypotheses and business impact.
>
> #7 – We expand testing abilities and knowhow across the team; understanding that this may reduce (or eliminate) the need for a dedicated testing specialist.
