Great summary of Seth Godin’s work. 

> **Idea #1: Ship**

> “The only thing shipping will cost you is little time and all of your ego.”
>
> **Idea #2: Wine Glasses**

> “People buy products that confirm the story they _want_ to believe about themselves.”
>
> **Idea #3: Milk Cartons**

> [Purple Cow] “If your message isn’t remarkable, it won’t be shared.”
>
> **Idea #4: Not For Everyone**

> [Mass marketing/business/production] … your best bet is to go in the opposite direction: specializing. 
> “A business for everyone is ultimately a business for no one.”
>
> **Idea #5: Quitting is OK**

> “Get hyper focused on defining your ‘best in the world’.”
>
> **Idea #6: Positioning > Product**

> Find all the various attributes that exist in your market place and see which combinations of these attributes your company can combine to create its own monopoly in a unique market.
> “Position yourself into a corner of the market where no one else is.”
>
> **Idea #7: What if you had to charge 10x for your product, how would you justify it?**

> “Price is a story.”
>
> **Idea #8: Locks Vs. Keys**

> “Find the lock. Find the people. Then, create your key.”
>
> **Idea #9: Who is it for, how did they get here and what do you want them to do?**

> “Start with who, then how and finish with what.”
>
> **Idea #10: Soon is not as good as now**

> It is much better to ship an unpolished product that the market can respond to …
> “The farmer who waits for perfect weather never plants.”
>
> **Idea #10.5: Trust is the new oxygen.**

> Some writers suggest a 5:1 ratio of helpful posts to asks for purchases, but I would argue it’s more like 500:1.
> “Trust is the single scarcest and most important resource you need to build your business.”
