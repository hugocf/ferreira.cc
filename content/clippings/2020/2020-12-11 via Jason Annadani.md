Interesting take on the number of interruptions vs size of the PR and the difficulty in having smaller PRs:

> So, interruptions are the cause of a balancing feedback loop preventing the system from reducing the batch size further. Meaning, motivation to review is conflicted from two sides (number of interruptions vs size of the PR) which prevents further reduction of PR size by a need to trade-off between these two.
