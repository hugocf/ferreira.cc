Stoicism being called for!

> **Stage No. 1: Security**
> …
> At this stage, I would focus on food, family, friends, and maybe fitness.
> …
> Cut out the noise.
> …
> Know that you are not failing. Let go of all of the profoundly daft ideas you have about what you _*should*_ be doing right now. Instead, **focus intensely on your physical and psychological security**.
> …
> Build a sustainable and safe social system now.

> ** Stage No. 2: The Mental Shift**
> …
> Given time, your brain can and will reset to new crisis conditions, and your ability to do higher-level work will resume.
> …
> However, do not rush or prejudge your mental shift, especially if you have never experienced a disaster before.
> …
> Our essential mental shifts require humility and patience. Focus on real internal change.
> …
> Be slow.
> …
> And so, may this tragedy tear down all our faulty assumptions and give us the courage of bold new ideas.

> **Stage No. 3: Embrace a New Normal**
> …
> Things will start to feel more natural.
> …
> Continue to embrace your mental shift. Have faith in the process. Support your team.
> **Understand that this is a marathon**. If you sprint at the beginning, you will vomit on your shoes by the end of the month.
> …
> Right now, work toward establishing your serenity, productivity, and wellness under sustained disaster conditions.
