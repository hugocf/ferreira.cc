Great summary/explanation about Metallica’s One, based on Johnny Got His Gun (1971)

> The song One by Metallica is based on the 1939 novel Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo which is about World War 1. 

> It’s about a wounded soldier who cannot see, cannot taste, cannot hear, cannot smell, and has no limbs but is very much alive and wishes for death in a constant state of regret and sorrow.

> In 1971, Johnny Got His Gun was made into a movie and this music video uses images and monologues from that movie.
