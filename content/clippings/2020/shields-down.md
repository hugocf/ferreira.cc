[Shields Down – Rands in Repose](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/)

> Your shields drop the moment you let a glimpse of a potential different future into your mind. It seems like a unconsidered off-the-cuff thought sans consequence, but the thought opens you to possibilities that **did not exist the moment before the thought existed.**

---

> Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields. Every single moment.

***Update 2024-03-27:** There are also [t-shirts and logos](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-shirts/) about it.*
