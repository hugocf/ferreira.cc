[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), keep it closer to the underlying technology, and introduce abstractions with a clear view about what problem their solving *(emphasis added)*

> There is a sweet spot of React: in **moderately interactive interfaces**. Complex forms that require immediate feedback, UIs that need to move around and react instantly. That’s where it excels. …

> The less interactive parts don’t benefit much from React. Listing pages, static pages, blogs - these things are increasingly built in React, but the benefits they accrue are extremely narrow. A lot of the optimizations we’re deploying to speed up these things, things like bundle splitting, server-side rendering, and prerendering, **are triangulating what we had before the rise of React**.
