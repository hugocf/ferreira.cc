Instead of unstructured logs + metrics:

> E.g. Logs will have something like :
>
>     Timestamp 1 : Calling service A with payload XXXX
>
>     Timestamp 2 : Received response from service A  : YYYY
>
> Metrics will have 
>
>     svc-A-call-count : 1
>
>     svc-A-resp-time : ZZZZ ms
>
> We can clearly see that the second piece of information is entirely derivable from the first, if only the first meant something. … The need for metrics despite having logs actually points to the fact that we are doing something very wrong

Use structure events to log:

> E.g. 
>
>     Event 1: {eventTime : 1234567, eventType: “request-sent”, target: “service A”, payload: “XXXX“, requestId : “E1”}
>
>     Event 2: {eventTime : 2345678, eventType: “response-sent”, target: “service A”, payload: “YYYY“, requestId : “E1”}
