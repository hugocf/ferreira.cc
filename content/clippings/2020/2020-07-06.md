> From observing … many other leaders over 40 years as an adult, it’s clear to me how good leaders behave.

> 1. Identify problems clearly and rationally
> 2. Develop a plan
> 3. Sell the plan
> 4. Persist, gather data, and adjust

> Every CEO I have worked for has done this. Some were great, some were pretty good, but they all tried.
