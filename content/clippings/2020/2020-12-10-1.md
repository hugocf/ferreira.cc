TODO: About #noestimates (is there a place already where i can add this?)

Agree with the conundrum and with the need to have an idea of what fits or not in a given timeframe. 

Still, estimates are too much guesswork in a field where most of what we do is new and not done before (that is, within a given context of a particular company, teams, tech stack, etc.). 

One approach I‚Äôve had success with is to forecast based on the team delivery record. It can be the average time per user story or an average number of user stories per time period. (inspired in some of what‚Äôs in the ‚ÄúNoEstimates‚Äù arguments but being pragmatic about it and without jumping on the cargo cult)

Yes, the size and complexity of user stories vary and teams have fluctuations. Still, in practice, I‚Äôve found these differences haven't affected the outcome: the ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù is in the ballpark of trying to estimate the best you can (i.e. just as bad üòè) but without the added strain and lost time of estimates (it can be derived from real board metrics).

What‚Äôs also interesting is that we can run this exercise at any time using the existing team‚Äôs metrics to understand/gain confidence if it would work or not.

For example, travelling back in time 3 months and seeing what simple forecasting would have predicted vs what really happened.
