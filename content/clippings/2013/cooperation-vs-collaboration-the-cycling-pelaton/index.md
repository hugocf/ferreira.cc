# Cooperation vs. Collaboration

> The cycling pelaton is a classic example of *cooperation* (as opposed
> to everybody's favourite, collaboration). The members of the pelaton
> do *not* have a shared objective: each member wants a *different*
> person to finish first. Nonetheless, they individuals have a better
> chance of succeeding if they work with the group -- *even with a group
> of competitors* -- than they would working on their own. And (note)
> they do not work as a team (despite what this post says) even though
> they share thre workload, communicate proactively, and engage with
> each other. They work as a murmuration. Nobody is in charge of a
> pelaton, membership is fluid and dynamic, and each exchange (of
> position, say) is negotiated individually.
