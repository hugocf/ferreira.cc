[Technical Q&A QA1633: Creating easy-to-read short links to the App
Store for your apps and
company](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1633/_index.html)

> There are three types of App Store Short Links, in two forms, one for
> iOS apps, another for Mac Apps:
>
> **Company Name**
>
> -   iOS: <http://appstore.com/> \<companyname\> for example,
>     <http://appstore.com/apple>
>
> -   Mac: <http://appstore.com/mac/> \<companyname\> for example,
>     <http://appstore.com/mac/apple>
>
> **App Name**
>
> -   iOS: <http://appstore.com/> \<appname\> for example,
>     <http://appstore.com/keynote>
>
> -   Mac: <http://appstore.com/mac/> \<appname\> for example,
>     <http://appstore.com/mac/keynote>
>
> **App by Company**
>
> -   iOS: <http://appstore.com/> \<companyname\>/\<appname\> for
>     example, <http://appstore.com/apple/keynote>
>
> -   Mac: <http://appstore.com/mac/> \<companyname\>/\<appname\> for
>     example, <http://appstore.com/mac/apple/keynote>
>
> Most companies and apps have a canonical App Store Short Link. This
> canonical URL is created by changing or removing certain characters
> (many of which are illegal or have special meaning in a URL (for
> example, "&")).
