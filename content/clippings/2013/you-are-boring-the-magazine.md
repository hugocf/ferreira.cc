[You Are Boring --- The
Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/4/you-are-boring)

> A few years ago, I had a job that involved listening to a ton of

> The people who were interesting told good stories. They were also
> inquisitive: willing to work to expand their social and intellectual
> range. Most important, interesting people were also the best
> listeners. They knew when to ask questions. (...)

> Here are the three things they taught me.

> **Listen, then ask a question**

> Stranger #1: Thing about my life.\
> Stranger #2: Thing about my life that is somewhat related to what you

> Really listen. Ask questions; the person you're speaking with will

> valuable to the many people who will see it? (...)

> **Tell a story**
>
> Shitty pictures of your food are all over the Internet. (...) Instead,
> think of your photo as a story. When people tell stories, they think
> about how to communicate the entirety of their experience to someone
> else. They set the stage, introduce characters, and give us a reason
> to care. (...)

> **Expand your circles**
>
> (...) Stepping out of your social comfort zone can be painful, but
> it's one of the most rewarding things you can do.
>
> As you widen your social circle, work on your intellectual one as
> well. Expose yourself to new writers. Hit the Random Article button on
> Wikipedia. Investigate the bromides your friends chuck around Twitter
> like frisbees.
>
> When you expand your social and intellectual range, you become more
> interesting. You're able to make connections that others don't see.
