> If you wanna be something, start being it. (...) Not tomorrow, but
> today!
>
> Get your work in front of other people (...) you really respect.
>
> When you get a criticism, you don't have to take all of it, or none of
> it. You get to piece it a apart and take the part which you think are
> valuable and throw away the ones you think aren't really worth it.
>
> There a different between the craft of the creative work that you do
> and the craft of making money off of that creative work.
