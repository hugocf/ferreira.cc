[The 5 Ps: Achieving Focus in Any Endeavor  |  cek.log](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2011/06/14/the-5-ps-achieving-focus-in-any-endeavor/)

> The 5 Ps : PURPOSE, PRINCIPLES, PRIORITIES, PLAN, AND PEOPLE (...) a
> tool that helps projects be focused: the "5Ps":
>
> -   **Purpose** : Why do we exist? Why are we in business? Where do we
>     want to be in the future? What will we deliver?
> -   **Principles** : What are the non-negotiable rules and key
>     strategies? How will we act?
> -   **Priorities** : What's the framework for tradeoffs?
> -   **Plan** : How are we going to stage and tackle solving the
>     problems? What are the known dates & forcing functions on the
>     calendar?
> -   **People** : Who's accountable for every key part of the plan?

> There are tons of frameworks/tools for helping people understand roles
> & responsibilities. (...) They can all be made to work, as long as you
> don't over-do it (just like you should not over-do the 5 Ps). To
> illustrate (...) I'll use
> [RACI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)
> :
>
> -   **Responsible** -- The individual(s) who do the work to achieve
>     the deliverable.
> -   **Approver** -- The one (and only one!) person who is ultimately
>     answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the
>     deliverable.
> -   **Consulted** -- Those whose opinions are sought; generally via
>     two-way communication.
> -   **Informed** -- Those who are neither responsible, accountable, or
>     consulted; but told.
>
> Use whatever tool you want, but you do need to explicitly write down
> the names of individuals for each part of your plan. Avoid naming
> groups such as partners; if I can't identify a person I usually view
> that as a red-flag and something that needs to be followed up on.
