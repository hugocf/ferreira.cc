> **Customer Self Service**\
> Achieving significant revenue at a low price point naturally entails
> driving complexity and cost out of the purchase to clear the
> floodgates for high volume.
>
> **Transactional Sales\
> ** As price increases, customers become less willing to part with
> their cash without at least knowing there are actual trustworthy human
> beings behind your website URL.
>
> **Enterprise Sales\
> ** While most SaaS startups gravitate toward transactional sales or
> customer self-service, some SaaS startups have products that provide
> so much value per customer and are so complex to buy that their
> natural starting point is traditional enterprise sales.
