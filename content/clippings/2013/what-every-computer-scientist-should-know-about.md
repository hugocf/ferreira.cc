[What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point
Arithmetic](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)

> Floating-point arithmetic is considered an esoteric subject by many
> people. This is rather surprising because floating-point is ubiquitous
> in computer systems. Almost every language has a floating-point
> datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point
> accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile
> floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every
> operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as
> overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of
> floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer
> systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation
> and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE
> floating-point standard, and concludes with numerous examples of how
> computer builders can better support floating-point.
