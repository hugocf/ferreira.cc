> App.io, previously Kickfolio, allows developers to test drive their
> iOS apps in any browser, on any device.
>
> No Downloads. No UDIDs. Just a simple testing page in the browser
> featuring your live, interactive app. With App.io, developers are able
> to simply upload their test builds and share a link with their testers
> and clients.
