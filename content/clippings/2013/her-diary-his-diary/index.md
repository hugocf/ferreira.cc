> **HER DIARY:**
>
> Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to
> meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. I was shopping with my friends
> all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit
> late, but he made no comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing, so I
> suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but
> he didn't say much. I asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing'. I
> asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't
> upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.
> On the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and
> kept driving. I can't explain his behavior I don't know why he didn't
> say, 'I love you, too.' When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him
> completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat
> there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and
> absent. Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed.
> About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was
> distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep -- I
> cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are
> with someone else. My life is a disaster.

> **HIS DIARY:**

> My code is broken, can't figure out why.
