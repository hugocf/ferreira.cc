> Scientists have been studying the way we react to colors for many
> years. Certain colors make us feel a certain way about something. As
> long as the designer knows what these colors and emotions are, the
> designer can use that information to help present the business in the
> right way. These are not hard and fast rules but smart designers use
> the information to their clients advantage.
