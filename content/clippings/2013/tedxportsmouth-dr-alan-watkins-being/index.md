> Your performance and results...
>
> 1.  ... depend on your **behaviour**
> 2.  ... which depends on what you **think**
> 3.  ... which depends on how you **feel**
> 4.  ... which depends on your **emotions**
> 5.  ... which depend on your **physiology**

> (...) the dominant factor in the *thinking \<=\> feeling* loop is
> **feeling**
>
> (...) **feelings** are the awareness of your raw **emotions**
>
> (...) think of **emotion** as *e* *nergy* in *motion* *\
> *
>
> (...) the key *data stream* from the **physiology** level is the HRV (
> *Heart Rate Variability* ), which alters brain function:
>
> -   under pressure =\> HRV becomes chaotic
> -   super chaos =\> shuts off frontal lobes
> -   shutdown =\> DIY lobotomy (the " *stupid* " pils)

> Key aspects of your breathing that you can regulate:
>
> 1.  Steady rhythm
> 2.  Smooth even breaths
> 3.  Through the centre of your chest

> So it doesn't really matter whether the heart rate is 50 or 120, what
> matters is am I on the left \[ **coherent** \] or am I on the right \[
> **erratic** \].
>
> High rate, high adrenaline emotions (120 bpm):
>
> -   Coherent --- Passion, Determination, Focus
> -   Erratic --- Anxiety, Anger, Frustration
>
> Low rate, relaxation emotions (\~50 bpm):
>
> -   Coherent --- Contentment, Curiosity,
>     [Equanimity](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equanimity)
> -   Erratic --- Apathy, Boredom, Detachment, Indifference
>
> (...) regulating your **physiology** will get you to the mid point
> \[from erratic to coherent\].
