Considering the base rates stated in the tool, we can derive the
following effort estimates which, in my opinion, are much more
interesting to analyse (from a development point of view):

         =
         
          50-83h
         
         — Basic stand-alone app with stock UI
    + 30-50h — Add custom UI matching existing brand
    + 40-67h — Add original design for that custom UI
    + 20-33h — Login system via email only
    + 10-17h — Add login via social media also
    + 30-50h — In-app payments
    + 80-133h — Sync data across devices
    + 50-83h — User ratings & reviews
    + 30-50h — User profiles
    + 30-50h — Website integration
    + ~8h — Creating a custom app icon
