**Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design\
** *(via [Vitsœ  |  Good
design](https://www.vitsoe.com/rw/about/good-design) )*

Good design...

1.  ... is innovative
2.  ... makes a product useful
3.  ... is aesthetic
4.  ... makes a product understandable
5.  ... is unobtrusive
6.  ... is honest
7.  ... is long-lasting
8.  ... is thorough down to the last detail
9.  ... is environmentally-friendly
10. ... is as little design as possible

>
> Born in 1932, Dieter Rams is one of the foremost industrial designers
> of the 20th century.
>
> For his entire career Rams has worked almost exclusively for two
> companies: Braun, the German electrical products company and, to this
> day, Vitsœ.
