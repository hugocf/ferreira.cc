> This is a bold claim, but i stand behind it: if you learn and follow
> these five typography rules, you will be a better typographer than 95%
> of professional writers and 70% of professional designers. (The rest
> of this book will raise you to the 99th percentile in both
> categories.)
>
> All it takes is ten minutes---five minutes to read these rules once,
> then five minutes to read them again.
