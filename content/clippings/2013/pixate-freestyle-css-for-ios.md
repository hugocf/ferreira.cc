[Pixate Freestyle --- CSS for iOS](http://www.pixate.com/)

> ~~Pixate is a free framework that lets you style your native iOS views
> with stylesheets.~~

*Update 2014-12-06*

**Pixate** has pivoted into some kind of "prototyping" tool, but their
original library is open sourced and still available as **Freestyle** :

-   [Freestyle -- A simple, powerful way to define a native app's look
    and feel, using CSS](http://www.freestyle.org)

    CSS](https://github.com/tombenner/nui)

And similar:

    , using a simple JSON dictionary.
