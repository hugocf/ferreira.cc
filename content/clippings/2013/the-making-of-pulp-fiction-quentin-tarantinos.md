[The Making of Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's and the Cast's
Retelling  |  Vanity
Fair](http://m.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/making-of-pulp-fiction-oral-history)

> The first independent film to gross more than \$200 million, Pulp
> Fiction was a shot of adrenaline to Hollywood's heart, reviving John
> Travolta's career, making stars of Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman,
> and turning Bob and Harvey Weinstein into giants. How did Quentin
> Tarantino, a high-school dropout and former video-store clerk, change
> the face of modern cinema? Mark Seal takes the director, his
> producers, and his cast back in time, to 1993.
