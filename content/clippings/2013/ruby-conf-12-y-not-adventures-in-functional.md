Ruby Conf 12 -- **Y Not: Adventures in Functional Programming** by Jim Weirich (by [Confreaks](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FITJMJjASUs&desktop_uri=/watch?v=FITJMJjASUs))

> One of the deepest mysteries in the functional programming world is
> the Y-Combinator. Many have heard of it, but few have mastered its
> mysteries. Although fairly useless in real world software,
> understanding how the Y-Combinator works and why it is important gives
> the student an important insight into the nature of functional
> programming.
