Understanding the Job (by [University of Phoenix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y) )

> The jobs-to-be-done framework is a tool for evaluating the
> circumstances that arise in customers' lives. (...) they often buy
> things because they find themselves with a problem that they need to
> solve. With an understanding of the "job" for which customers find
> themselves "hiring" a product or service, companies can more
> accurately develop and market products well-tailored to what customers
> are already trying to do.
