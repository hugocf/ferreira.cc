[IntentKit --- The iOS tool for inter-app
linking](http://intentkit.github.io/)

> IntentKit is an open-source iOS library that makes it easier to link
> to other apps. It's sort of like Android's Intents or Windows Phone's
> Contracts.

For example:

> If the user has multiple web browsers installed, this will display a
> modal sheet (similar to an iOS 7-style UIActivityViewController)
> listing each available application.
