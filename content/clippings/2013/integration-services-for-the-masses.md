Today, suddenly two companies in the same space crossed [my
radar](http://twitter.com/hugocf) :

-   [Bondable  |  The Cloud Integration Enablement
    Platform](http://bondable.com)
-   [Zapier -- Automate the Web](http://zapier.com)

Together with the earlier "If This Then That", seems like more and more
people are starting to feel the need to hook up together several
disparate web services.
