[Dieter Rams: Design by Vitsœ](https://www.vitsoe.com/files/assets/1000/17/VITSOE_Dieter_Rams_speech.pdf)

Speech delivered in December 1976 to an audience at Jack Lenor Larsen's New York showroom:

> The designer must be the gestaltingenieur or creative engineer. They
> synthesise the completed product from the various elements that make
> up its design. Their work is largely rational, meaning that aesthetic
> decisions are justified by an understanding of the product's purpose.
