[How Medium Is Building a New Kind of Company with No Managers](http://firstround.com/article/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers)

> For two years, Stirman managed a team at Twitter and never felt quite
> right about it. There was always the tension between being their boss
> and being their peer.
>
> (...)
>
> He started taking his reports out to lunch, to drinks, to coffee to
> see what was up. How was their wife settling into her new job? Did
> escrow close on their new house? This is the stuff that people bring
> into work with them but never talk about, Stirman says. As soon as you
> ask, the pressure starts to dissipate.

> **SCARF** stands for **status** , **certainty** , **autonomy** ,
> **relatedness** , and **fairness** . "Basically, when a person is
> honest with themselves, they're most motivated by one of those
> qualities," Stirman explains. (...) Here's how it looks:
>
> -   **Status** -oriented employees can be motivated by a possible
>     title change, or having their name attached to more important
>     projects.
> -   **Certainty** -oriented employees are motivated simply by the
>     reassurance that their job is important and they are excelling.
> -   **Autonomy** -oriented employees may need the ability to work from
>     home, or simply slip on their head phones to tune everyone else
>     out.
> -   **Relatedness** -oriented employees are energized by opportunities
>     to socialize with their coworkers --- happy hours, softball games,
>     etc.
> -   **Fairness** -oriented employees want to know the playing field is
>     even, and they aren't being exploited or cheated. They need to
>     hear it consistently.
>
> "It turns out that some people really care about one and don't really
> care about the others," says Stirman. "Once I had my team stack rank
> their priorities, I knew exactly how to reach them. All the little
> problems and personality clashes started to fade."

> In fact the Holacracy organization just [released 4.0 of its
> constitution](http://holacracy.org/blog/holacracy-constitution-40-released)
> , so our company is upgrading --- just like you would update to a new
> iOS."
>
> Here are some of the key tenets that Medium embraces:
>
> -   **No people managers** . Maximum autonomy.
> -   **Organic expansion** . When a job gets too big, hire another
>     person.
> -   **Tension resolution** . Identify issues people are facing, write
>     them down, and resolve them systematically.
> -   **Make everything explicit** --- from vacation policies to
>     decision makers in each area.
> -   **Distribute decision-making** power and discourage consensus
>     seeking.
> -   **Eliminate all the extraneous factors** that worry people so they
>     can focus on work.
