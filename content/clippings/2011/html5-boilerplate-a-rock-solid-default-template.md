[HTML5 Boilerplate -- A rock-solid default template for HTML5
awesome.](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

> HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional badass's base HTML/CSS/JS
> template for a fast, robust and future-proof site.
>
> After more than three years in iterative development, you get the best
> of the best practices baked in: cross-browser normalization,
> performance optimizations, even optional features like cross-domain
> Ajax and Flash. A starter apache .htaccess config file hooks you the
> eff up with caching rules and preps your site to serve HTML5 video,
> use \@font-face, and get your gzip zipple on.
