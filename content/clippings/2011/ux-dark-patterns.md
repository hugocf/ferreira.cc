[UX Dark Patterns](http://darkpatterns.org/)

> Normally when you think of "bad design", you think of laziness or
> mistakes. These are known as design anti-patterns. Dark Patterns are
> different -- they are not mistakes, they are carefully crafted with a
> solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the
> user's interests in mind.
