> (...) *flow* is completely focused motivation.
>
> Colloquial terms for this or similar mental states include: *to be on
> the ball, in the moment, present, in the zone, wired in, in the
> groove, or keeping your head in the game* .

> Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve
> a flow state:
>
> 1.  One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals.
>     (...)
> 2.  The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. (...)
> 3.  (...) One must have confidence that he or she is capable to do the
>     task at hand.
