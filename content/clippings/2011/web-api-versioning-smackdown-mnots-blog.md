> The key insight here, I think, is that URIs are used for so many
> things --- persistent identifiers, cache keys, bases for relative
> resolution, bookmarks --- that overloading them with versioning and
> extensibility information as well makes them worse for all of their
> various purposes. By pushing these concerns into link relations and
> media types using HATEOS, you end up with a flexible, future-proof
> system that can evolve in a controllable way, without giving up the
> benefits of using HTTP (never mind REST).
