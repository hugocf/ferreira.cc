[TAP -- Test Anything
Protocol](http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)

> TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is a simple text-based interface
> between testing modules in a test harness.
>
> TAP started life as part of the test harness for Perl but now has
> implementations in C, C , Python, PHP, Perl, Java and others.
>
> Here's what a TAP test stream looks like:
>
>           1..4
>     ok 1 - Input file opened
>     not ok 2 - First line of the input valid
>     ok 3 - Read the rest of the file
>     not ok 4 - Summarized correctly
>           
>            # TODO Not written yet
>
