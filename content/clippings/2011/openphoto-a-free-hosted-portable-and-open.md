[OpenPhoto -- A free, hosted, portable and open source photo sharing
service](http://theopenphotoproject.org/)

> OpenPhoto is a way to store and share your photos while keeping
> control and ownership of them.
>
> OpenPhoto works similarly to Flickr, Smugmug and other photo sharing
> services with one major difference: **you retain ownership and give
> OpenPhoto access to use them** . All photos, tags and comments are
> stored in your personal cloud accounts with companies like Amazon,
> Rackspace or Google.
>
> This means you can easily switch between OpenPhoto services, use more
> than one at a time or stop using them altogether while retaining all
> of your photos, tags and comments.
