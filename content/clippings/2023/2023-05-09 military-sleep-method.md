> Detailed in the book *Relax and Win: Championship Performance*, 1981, the technique is thought to have been developed by army chiefs to ensure soldiers didn’t make life-threatening mistakes due to exhaustion.
>
> Here’s how to do it:
>
> 1. Relax the muscles in your face, including tongue, jaw and the muscles around the eyes
> 2. Drop your shoulders as far down as they’ll go, followed by your upper and lower arm, one side at a time
> 3. Breathe out, relaxing your chest followed by your legs, starting from the thighs and working down
> 4. You should then spend 10 seconds trying to clear your mind before thinking about one of the three following images:
>    * You’re lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you
>    * You’re lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room
>    * You say “don’t think, don’t think, don’t think” to yourself over and over for about 10 seconds.
