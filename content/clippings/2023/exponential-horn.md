> The actual model that more closely resembles what we need should have the bare minimum of E2E tests, quite a number of service tests and the vast majority should be unit tests.
>
>> Exponential model: x = 10^hy
>
> So if the height h goes from 1 to 2 to 3 then we have 1 E2E test to 100 service tests to 10,000 unit tests.
>
> There is a physical object which has these properties, it is called an [exponential horn](https://robinthefog.com/tag/exponential-horn/)
