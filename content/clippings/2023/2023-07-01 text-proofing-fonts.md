Documents and tools for proofing fonts, by Jonathan Hoefler.  
*(originally published in 2020-05-19)*

> In 2015, I dumped the pangrams we’d accumulated and rewrote our proofs from scratch, trading their wacky and self-satisfied cleverness for lists of words that are actually illustrative.
>
> My initial goal was to show each letter between flat- and round-sided neighbors, to illustrate categorically how each letter was spaced.

> I also thought it might be useful if our proofs demonstrated each letter at the start of a word, and at the end, and also — crucially — doubled: …

> But *most* importantly, I wanted to organize the text logically, so that instead of spending a whole afternoon stalking a wild **K** in the bush, I’d always know exactly where to find it.

> Finally, I wanted the text to have the visual cadences of my native English, in which words of variable but digestible length are punctuated by shorter ones.
