> But first, why has the prevalent myth that we need to “finish the design first”, stuck around? I’ll wager a guess: back when we first started moving online, we naturally brought development methodologies from the offline world.

> Mantra 1: design only what you need at the moment

> Mantra 2: implement the design immediately

> Mantra #3: break big features into smaller chunks—during the design stage

> Mantra #4: organize communication between design and development

> Bonus: cultivate or find these qualities in your product designers
