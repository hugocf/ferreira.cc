# 2023-04-17 inbox-zero


Merlin Mann on how the term “inbox zero” has been misunderstood.

> Accept that almost everything in your life is an inbox

> Whatever you do, don't delete everything

> Allow yourself time to switch off

> Don't be an inbox dick

[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/inbox-zero-mentality](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/inbox-zero-mentality)

The original concept:

> That “zero?” It’s not how many mes­sages are in your inbox–it’s how much of your own *brain* is in that inbox. Especially when you don’t want it to be. That’s it.
