TODO: Clip the image

> As 32F is 0C and each ~~Celsius~~ Fahrenheit is almost double each ~~Fahrenheit~~ Celsius, you can roughly go from Fahrenheit to Celsius by subtracting 32 and dividing by 2 â€¦ Not perfect, but often good enough if you're trying to work out if it'll be hot out. To go from Celsius to Fahrenheit it's the reverse, times by 2 and add 32.
