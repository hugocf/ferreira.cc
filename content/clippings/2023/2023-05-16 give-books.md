2023-05-16 give-books


Avoid the perception that…

> “I’m giving this away to everyone I know, because it’s not worth paying for.”

Treat it as being valuable…

> There are three reasons to give away books in physical or ebook format.
>
> • To boost your reputation.
> • To generate reviews or otherwise promote the book.
> • To thank someone.

Remember: Spam = Crap

> … don’t spam your book unless you want people to think of it as crap.
