> Mend Renovate is a dependency update automation tool. It scans your software, discovers dependencies, automatically checks to see if an updated version exists, and helps you by submitting automated pull requests.

https://www.mend.io/renovate/
https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate

Same space as dependabot but looks like with more language/package managers support and richer PRs (with “confidence level” and embed release notes of the new versions)
