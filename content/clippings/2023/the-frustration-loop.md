[The Frustration Loop | ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ Herman's blog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-frustration-loop/)

> This lead me to an idea: The Frustration Loop
>
> The premise is simple. When spam is detected, instead of blocking the blog, fake system error or failure in the most frustrating way possible. Waste their time and make them give up.
>
> I got the idea from [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/) which I highly recommend checking out.

> Since implementing The Frustration Loop the amount of spam has dropped from about 30% of new blogs, to less than 5% (nothing is perfect). There are a few improvements to be made, and some holes to patch, but it's working well.
