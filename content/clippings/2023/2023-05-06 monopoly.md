> What is worth it changes depending on how many opponents you have:
>
> If you have just **1 opponent**, then the **light blue** set or the **orange** set are the best ones.
>
> If you have **2 or 3 opponents**, then it's **orange** and **red** that you wanna go for.
>
> Any more than that, any **more than 3 opponents**, **green**.

> Don't bother with train stations, utilities, etc.

> The other thing that the numbers say is that you will get your money back on **3 houses**, quite quickly. 4 houses takes a long time, 5 houses (an hotel) as well.

> The one advantage also to only having 3 houses rather than investing in hotels, early on, because there are a limited number of houses in the game, you can block your family.
