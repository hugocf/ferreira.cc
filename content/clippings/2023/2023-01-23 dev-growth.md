Simple framework for what should Software Engineers work on as they grow?

> 1. Taking on tasks that have a clear solution. Usually, the solution will be written out for you already.
>
> 2. Taking on tasks that have multiple known solutions or worse yet, no known solution. Choosing the solution is up to you.
>
> 3. Taking on problems or “situations” (not “tasks” anymore), that are extremely unclear. You have to reach out to others, do a lot of research and figure out what we should do and execute on it.
>
> 4. Identify the problems or “situations” we should tackle (and then you may or may not lead the resolutions). The main thing at stake here is staying in tune with the business. You have to put on the hat of a product manager and figure out the ways in which we should change course (we may be under or overinvesting in different areas).
