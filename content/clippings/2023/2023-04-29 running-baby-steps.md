The gist of it, to build persistence:

* Keep it small and achievable (each step shold feel easy to do)
* Don’t exceed your abilitiy (leave feeling you could do more)
* Stay in the “moderate” zone 3 (70%–80%)

The daily plan:

1. Put your running shoes at the door
2. Schedule a run in your calendar for tomorrow
3. Run a few min down the road and back (keep it confortable)
4. Rest day
5. 6 x day run repeating #3
6. Rest day

Repeat the last bullets and you’ll naturally increase the distance as your body adjust.

Don’t force it or try to hit milestones. Go with the flow of what feeds good and pleasurable, so you know every day you aren’t going to be miserable.

See,
