> An exploration of rhythm and grooves that break the rules

> The beat that captivated Questlove was made by the legendary James Dewitt Yancey, better known as J Dilla. Although he only lived to 32 and never had a mainstream hit, he is now considered one of the most influential producers in hip hop and popular music. The songs he produced reshaped our understanding of rhythm and time, and their influence persists among many musicians today.
>
> At first glance, it might look like chaos, but beneath the surface lies a meticulously crafted rhythmic sensibility. We’ll break down the techniques and subtleties that go into these grooves that break the rules.
