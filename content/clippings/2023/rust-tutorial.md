[Introduction - PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/)

> This guide is intended to fill the gap between heavily directed beginner tutorials and working on your own projects. The primary goal here is to get you writing code. The secondary goal is to get you reading documentation.
>
> If you haven't read [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) yet, I highly encourage you to do so before attempting this project. This guide does not cover any language features.
