2023-05-28 double-diamond-problem

 
> Just as the problem space illuminates and reveals the solution space, so too does the solution space illuminate and reveal the problem space. The double diamond is a great reflection of the way we often think of innovation happening, but it’s not the way that it actually happens.

> Sentiments like these seem related to _the value that designers bring by being active participants in mob programming_. In the opposite direction, we’re starting to see _the benefits of including developers directly in user interviews and other UX research activities_. Stating it from the other side, the more we divide designers and developers, the less both teams accomplish. To be successful, we need cross-functional teams — and the closer we get to that goal, the more successful those teams will be.

> The key idea is simple: If we are continuously making decisions about what to build, we need to stay continuously connected to our customers, so that we can ensure that our product discovery decisions will work for our customers.
