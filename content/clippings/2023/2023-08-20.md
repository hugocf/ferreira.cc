> Session tokens are pretty secure. The threats described above are easily fixed with other measures, such as disk encryption, locking your computer, or HttpOnly cookies.

Even so, if someone compromises your session, you’re screwed whether it lasts five minutes or for ever. Attacks that are prevented by short session timeouts are really rare.

Finally, short session timeouts come with security and user experience costs.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and GitHub have sessions that never expire. They think it’s an acceptable risk. I think they are right.
