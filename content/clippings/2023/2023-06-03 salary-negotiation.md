2023-06-03 salary-negotiation


> Your salary negotiation — which routinely takes less than 5 minutes to conclude — has an outsized influence on what your compensation is.

> Nobody will read it [resume], because **resumes are an institution created to mean that no one has to read resumes**.

> **When Does A Salary Negotiation Happen?**
>
> Only negotiate salary after you have agreement in principle from someone with hiring authority that, if a mutually acceptable compensation can be agreed upon, you will be hired.
>
> …
>
> First, the company is going to spend a lot of time and effort on getting you to the point of agreement-in-principle. … Walking away from the negotiation means that they lose all that investment. … They really want to reach an agreement with you.
>
> The second implication is that the inner serf worrying “If I even attempt to negotiate this, the deal will fall through” is worrying for nothing. … **negotiating never makes (worthwhile) offers worse**. This means you need what political scientists call a commitment strategy: you always, as a matter of policy, negotiate all offers.
>
> …
>
> This also means **you do not start negotiating until you already have a Yes-If**.  (Yes-If we agree on terms.)  Do not start negotiating from No-But.  (No-But we might hire you anyway if you’re really, really effing cheap.)

> **The First Rule Is What Everyone Tells You It Is: Never Give A Number First**
>
> …
>
> So anyhow, you may well hear reasons why you should give a number.
>
> **Objection**: “…”
>
> **What you should think**: “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”
>
> **What you should say**: …

> **Listen To What People Tell You.  Repeat It Back To Them**
>
> Properly run negotiations are not jockeying contests, they’re persuasive exercises. … You know what people find persuasive?  Their own words.
>
> …
>
> **Micro-tip**: Take notes during job interviews and salary negotiations.
>
> …
>
> **Micro-tip**: Notice how often I say “We” and variations on “mutual win.”  Those work pretty well.  The only thing better than “We” is “You” (and variants), because people care a heck of a lot more about their problems than about your problems.

> **Research, Research, Research**
>
> … (go to a salary aggregation site, guess what “the position” is, pray that this gives you a better number than rand(40000,120000)) … Prospective peers within the company are one obvious way to get it.  So are ex-employees, folks who’ve had dealings with them professionally, etc.

> **New Information Is Valuable And Can Be Traded For Things You Want**
>
> …
> 
> Anyhow, simply by bringing attention to something which was hopefully already in bold print on their resume, they just increased their perceived value to the company, thus justifying the company moving a lever which (again) the company isn’t really sensitive to at the end of the day.

> **You Have A Multi-Dimensional Preference Set.  Use It.**
>
> Don’t overly focus on your salary number.  It is important (of course), but there are many parts of your compensation package, and many more things that you value.
>
> …
>
> **Micro-tip**: “Interesting” is a wonderful word: it is positive and non-commital at the same time.  If they tell you a number, tell them it is an “interesting” number, not a “wonderful” number.
>
> …
>
> … [If] your decisionmaker says that approving deviations from the company’s salary structure is outside of his discretion … then refocus the discussion on things which are within his personal authority.  (Vacation days, work hours, project assignments, travel opportunities, professional development opportunities, and the like are good areas to probe at.)
