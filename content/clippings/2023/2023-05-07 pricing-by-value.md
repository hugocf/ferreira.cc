# 2023-05-07 pricing-by-value


> Pricing is much more about positioning and perceived value than it is about cost-analysis and _unconvincing ROI calculators_.

> It’s always 10x more valuable for a business to *grow faster* than it is for the business to *save money*.

> So the next time you want to formulate your product as a way to “save time” or “save money” or “be more efficient” …. don’t.
>
> Instead, figure out how your product creates value in the way your customer already measures value, and position your product as a way to accomplish *that*.
