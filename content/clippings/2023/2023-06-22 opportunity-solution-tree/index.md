*The opportunity solution tree helps teams examine their thinking.*



> To start, define a clear desired outcome.


> Next, discover opportunities that drive that desired outcome.


> Finally, run experiments to discover solutions that deliver on those opportunities in a way that drives your desired outcome.

*The Opportunity Solution Tree helps us put al of our different tools and methodologies into context. (28:24)*




1.  **Desired outcomes** ➔ OKRs
2.  **Oportunity finding** ➔ Jobs-to-be-Done; Design thinking
3.  **Solution / Expriment** ➔ Usability testing, The Lean Startup, MVPs



> So our tools might change, but what we're trying to do I don't think is going to change. And the reason why I don't think that, is that we have 100 years of research on good decision making, good problem solving, and good critical thinking. It is all consistent with this idea, of start with an outcome, explore the problem space, and use the problem space as a way to expand the solution space. And as you explore solutions, it feeds back into your understanding of the problem.


To evaluate new tools and methodoligies, frame them with the Opportunity Solution Tree:


> First, does it help me learn something faster? If the answer is yes, you want to adopt it.
>
> Second, what does it help me learn faster? Does it help me set a desired outcome? Does it help me discover opportunities, or does it help me discover solutions?
>
> And that helps you understand what to use when.


About how product decisions work and how they evolve over time, with knowledge:


> *[focusing on individual studies]* But that is not how we learn, that is not how research works. The way to know if coffee is good for you, we have to look at the whole set of studies that have ever been done on coffee, and do a meta-analysis and say, based on everything that we know today, what's the best decision we can make about drinking coffee.
>
> And here's the thing, a year from now that answer might change, because during that year more studies are going to be done and the data might start to look a little bit different.
>
> The same is true with product decisions, so we don't want to make a decision based on one A/B test, we don't want to make a decision based on one customer interview. We want to make our product decisions based on sets of data, sets of research activities.


The "what good looks like" goal to aim for is:


> ... smaller size research done week over week by the team building the products, and our products are going to get significantly better.
