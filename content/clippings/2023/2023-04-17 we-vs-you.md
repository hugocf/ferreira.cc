# 2023-04-17 we-vs-you


> When you want to write advice to your audience, use “you” and commands. …
>
> When you want to include the reader in a conspiratorial huddle to create empathy, use “we.” …
>
> When these two imperative conflict, be explicit about the switch. Make them comfortable using “we” to describe common problems, then switch to advice using “you.” To avoid confusion, don’t use both in the same sentence or paragraph.
