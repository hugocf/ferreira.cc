[The Musk Algorithm](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-musk-algorithm-977bf312)

The order is very important:

> 1. Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. …
> 2. Delete any part or process you can. …
> 3. Simplify and optimize. … common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.
> 4. Accelerate cycle time. Every process can be speeded up. …
> 5. Automate. That comes last. …
