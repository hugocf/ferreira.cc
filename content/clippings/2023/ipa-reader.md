[IPA Reader](http://ipa-reader.xyz/)

> This is a tool for reading [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) notation aloud.
>
> It makes it easy to actually hear how words are pronounced based on their phonetic spelling, without having to look up each character in [the IPA chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/IPA_chart_2018.pdf)and string the sounds together yourself.
