2023-05-10 problem-of-induction

 
> First formulated by David Hume, the **problem of induction** questions our reasons for believing that the future will resemble the past, or more broadly it questions predictions about unobserved things based on previous observations.

We cannot be *certain* about the future from past observations alone.

But we can make educated *guesses* about that future, with different levels of probability, from those observations.

Evolving and revisitng our knowledge as that future unfolds is the different between theroy (philosophy) and practice (engineering)
