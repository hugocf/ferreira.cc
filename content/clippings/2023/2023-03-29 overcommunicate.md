# 2023-03-29 overcommunicate


Communicate often, (share) in multiple channels, (don’t be afraid to) repeat yourself.

> **Say it once, say it again**

> Perhaps the most persistent bit of advice I gathered — and in some ways the most counterintuitive — is the need for remote teams to overcommunicate.

> Further to that, there are different kinds of communication with different needs for redundancy.
