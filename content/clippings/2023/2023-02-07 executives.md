# 2023-02-07 executives


> How can anyone make any important decision in a company that large? They will always be the least informed person in the room, no matter what the topic.

> To paraphrase the book[[^1]] the job of an executive is: **to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.**
> 
> That's all.
> 
> Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.

[^1]: _High Output Management_, by Andy Grove (of [Intel fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove)), 1983

There’s an algorithm for it:

> For any disagreement, identify the lead person on each side. Then, identify the *lowest* executive in the corporate hierarchy that *both* leads report into (in the extreme case, this is the CEO). Set up a meeting between the three of them. At the meeting, the two leads will present the one, correct decision that they have agreed upon. The executive will sit there, listen, and ratify it.

> **Failure modes**

>
> What happens when an executive *doesn't* follow this model? …

> **Enforcement of culture and values**

> 
> … It means if someone in the company isn't acting "right" - not acting ethically, not following the conflict resolution algorithm above, playing politics - then they need to be corrected or removed.

> Real values aren't what you talk about, they're what you do when times get tough.

> **What about strategy?**

> 
> … executives *don't* set strategy. Not even the CEO sets strategy. Why? Because it's an illusion to believe you can enforce a strategy.

> What executives need to do is come up with organizational values that *indirectly* result in the strategy they want.

> Why will employees embrace whatever weird organizational values you set? Because in every decision meeting, you enforce your values.
