2023-06-26 debt-metaphor-max


> I really like the "tech debt" metaphor. A lot of people don't, but I think that's because they either don't extend the metaphor far enough, or because they don't properly understand financial debt.

> Debt is bad when you take out the wrong kind, or you mismanage it, or it has weird strings attached â€¦ But done right, debt is a way to move faster instead of slower.
