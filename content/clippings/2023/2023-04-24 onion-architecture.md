> Back in 2008, I defined four tenets of Onion Architecture:
>
>* • The application is built around an independent object model*

>* • Inner layers define interfaces.  Outer layers implement interfaces*

>* • Direction of coupling is toward the center*

>* • All application core code can be compiled and run separate from infrastructure*
