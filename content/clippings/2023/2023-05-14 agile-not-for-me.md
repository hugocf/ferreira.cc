> It turns out that the working relationship between software developers and their customers is, and always has been, the crux of the problem. Teams that work closely and communicate effectively with customers tend to build the right thing, at least. There’s no process, standard or boxes-and-arrows diagram that can fix a dysfunctional developer-customer relationship.

> Working closely with customers to solve real problems by rapidly iterating working software on small self-organizing teams very much is, still. But I fear the word for that has had its meaning so deeply corrupted that I need to start calling it something else.

Interesting, but way the produces software could be called “software development”.

How about “*costumer-first[^1]* *light-process[^2]* software developement”? 😏

[^1]: *all* team members, *all* roles in the team, have frequent interactions with end users and costumers to know their needs *without proxies*

[^2]: less than 1% of the *entire team*'s time spent in “process” related work (e.g. status reports, charts, planning, cerimonies and other typical project management chores)
