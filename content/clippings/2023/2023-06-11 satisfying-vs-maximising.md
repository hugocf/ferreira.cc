2023-06-11 satisfying-vs-maximising


> “Maximizing” means finding the best solution. It requires exploration and analysis to ensure “the best” option hasn’t been overlooked …

> “Satisficing” means picking the first or easiest or least-expensive option that satisfies the requirements. Preferring a faster decision to the best decision.

> For the most important decisions, maximize with _Binstack_. For almost anything else, satisficing is likely wiser.
>
> Be careful; the same perfectionism that makes you a force to be reckoned with (and that drives your _impostor syndrome_) will lead you to maximize too often.
