2023-01-14 career-switchers


> Here are a few reasons as to why you should hire someone who switched career:
> 
> - These people know what they don’t want (more importantly what they do want)
> - They are fierce and bold (it takes guts to switch careers)
> - They are looking for someone to believe in them and often times they deliver
> - They bring skills and knowledge from their previous roles and can be invaluable
> - They have senior mindset with junior drive
