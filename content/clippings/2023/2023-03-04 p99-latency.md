> Time is Money. Understanding application responsiveness and latency is critical but good characterization of bad data is useless. Gil Tene discusses some common pitfalls encountered in measuring latency and response time behavior. He introduces how simple, open sourced tools can be used to improve and gain higher confidence in both latency measurement and reporting.

> Think about what failure looks like in your system and measure the corresponding "misery metrics." You can reliably measure indicators like timeouts, retries, failed queries and even business-focused metrics like abandoned shopping carts. If those numbers are trending in a bad direction, who cares what your P99 is? There's clearly a problem ... go diagnose and fix it!


> For even more critical perspectives on measuring P99s, take a look at Charity Majors's spirited P99 CONF keynote as well as Alex Hidalgo's carefully crafted exploration on all the nines. Also see this great article by Jessica Wachtel.


> Charity Majors flat-out stated that P99 is BS because every user interaction counts. Even if you're hitting all your nines, "there can still be a whole bunch of pathologies. ..."
