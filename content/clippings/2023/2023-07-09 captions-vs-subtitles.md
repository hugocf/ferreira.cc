2023-07-09 captions-vs-subtitles


* TODO: Simplify the clipping below (cut out redundant wording)

> Captions:
>
> * Include background noises, speaker differentiation, and other relevant information, making content more accessible for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
> * Come in two forms, open or closed captions – closed captioning (CC) can be turned off by the viewer with the click of a button, while open captions are embedded into the video and cannot be turned off.

> Subtitles:
> 
> * Unlike closed captions, subtitles assume viewers can hear the audio and are typically used when the viewer doesn’t speak the language in the video. 
> * Typically used in movies when the language spoken in countries where the film is distributed is different than the language the film is shot in e.g. for a French film screened in an English-speaking country.
