[Messaging Patterns Overview - Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/)

> This pattern catalog describes 65 integration patterns, collected from many integration projects since 2002.

The inspiration to document these patterns came when we struggled through multiple integration vendors' product documentation just to realize later that many of the underlying concepts were quite similar.
