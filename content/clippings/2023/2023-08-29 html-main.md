About the benefits of the `<main>` HTML tag:

> 1. Skip to content links. When someone using keyboard navigation or AT wants to skip repeated content, they can easily skip to the `#main` content area.

> 2. Reader mode looks for the `<main>` element as well as headings and content structure when converting the content into reader view.

> 6. Without `<main>` assistive technology cannot create an accurate outline (accessibility tree) of the page's content.

See also,

> You could _read the spec_ or the _MDN docs which should be the de facto resource_ for researching anything HTML or CSS.
