# 2023-03-06 meetings-cure


> The most important cure is to **invest in great process**.

(**strong** added)

> The three best tips I’ve found for removing wasted meeting time are:
> 
> • **Do everything that doesn’t leverage** the unique quality of meetings — **synchronous discussion** — **some other way**. No updates, no FYIs, no rehashing of documents or update presentations. Cancel all meetings and all parts of meetings that are for these things (with special exceptions for cultural meetings like all-hands and celebrations). Meetings are for real-time conversations that yield more efficient progress than we could do any other way.
> • **Do the hardest part right away**. Slam it right down on the table, 5 minutes in. I’ve been in so many hour-long meetings that filled up the first 55 minutes with BS, only to finally get to the thing we *really* needed to decide in the last 5. Why didn’t we start by discussing that? No one knows. Then we ran out of time. And scheduled another meeting.
> • There is one piece of meeting hygiene I’m completely on board with — the meeting shareout. **You must document what happened in a meeting, then tell everyone**.** **If a meeting yielded a decision, but no one told the people who needed to know, was there even a meeting? I used to have meetings devoted to finding out what happened in other meetings. I do not miss them.
