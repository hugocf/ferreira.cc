You can enable rendering of Control Characters by going to **View > Render Control Characters** but I believe it's known to be a bit buggy.
Since that feature seems to be a little buggy right now, there are a couple of extensions you can check out. Render Line Endings will show you glyphs at the end of each line denoting which EOL character you used. Gremlins or Highlight Bad Chars will highlight all of the weird hidden characters in your code and besides the defaults, you can add your own characters to highlight. I believe it only works with Unicode characters though, so you'd have to just enter the Unicode equivalents of the hex Control Characters you wanted to look out for
