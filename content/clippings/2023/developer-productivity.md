> Speed and stability move together.
>
> Most people only think about this from the speed standpoit, which means, when you move faster you are most stable. … smaller changes … smaller blast radious … easier to debug … faster to restore.
>
> Wthat that also means is the reverse. When you push changes less frequently, you will have less stable systems. … very large batch changes … large blast radious … larger “ball of mud” to understand what is worng …
