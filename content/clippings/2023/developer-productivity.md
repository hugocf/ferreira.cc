> Speed and stability move together.
>
> Most people only think about this from the speed standpoit, which means, when you move faster you are most stable. ‚Ä¶ smaller changes ‚Ä¶ smaller blast radious ‚Ä¶ easier to debug ‚Ä¶ faster to restore.
>
> Wthat that also means is the reverse. When you push changes less frequently, you will have less stable systems. ‚Ä¶ very large batch changes ‚Ä¶ large blast radious ‚Ä¶¬†larger ‚Äúball of mud‚Äù to understand what is worng ‚Ä¶

<a id="summary">Summary</a> by [Tiago Almeida](https://twitter.com/_tiagoalmeida):

> *If you want you can skip to minute 10: first 8 are an intro, +2 talking about the relationship between DevOps, Dev Experience, and Productivity*
>
> üôà **Some contradictions**
>
> * Some executives answer her if ‚Äúdo we need to be faster?‚Äù
>     * Because they are afraid of the unknown trade-offs
>
> * We need to go faster, but also increase stability
>
> * Speed and stability move together
>
>     * Small changes and often
>
>         * More stable systems
>
>         * Easy to catch issues
>
>     * If we push large changes
>
>         * Large blast radius
>
>         * Big changes are hard to debug, reducing speed
>         * They also require a mental shift, because those changes could be done months ago
>
> üèÉ **Elite Performants**
>
> *What are signs of elite performant organizations?*
>
> * Deployment frequency: you can deploy on demand
> * Lead time for changes: less than a day
> * Time to restore: less than 1 hour
> * Change to failure rate is between 0 and 15%
> * You are not killing yourself, you are able to maintain a constant pace without brunout
>
> * We do not strive for precision in these metrics
>     * Less than 1 day is less than 1 day, it really doesn‚Äôt matter how many hours and minutes
>
> They also have:
>
> * Fast feedback loops
> * Trunk based development
> * Automated tests
>
> üßê **Some curiosities**
>
> * No statical differences between large and small companies
>
>     * Large companies say they have complex codebases, so many things to do
>
>     * Small companies say large companies have so much money and resources, this is not applies to me
>
> üé© **New things learned**
>
> * SPACE frameworks helps picking up the metrics we should be measuring for
>
>     * Satisfaction and well being
>
>         * Highly correlated with productivity and doing things well
>
>         * As soon as this starts to falling off everything starts to fail
>
>     * Performance
>
>     * Activity
>
>         * Usually a number
>
>         * Super easy to automate and collect
>
>     * Communication and collaboration
>
>         * How people communicate
>
>         * How our system communicate
>
>         * Searchability of a codebase
>
>     * Efficiency and Flow
>
>         * Time through the system
>
>         * Number of a hops a ticket takes until it reaches the right person
>
> * To use SPACE correctly we want to have 3 dimensions to balance things out
>
>     * DORA is a implementation of SPACE
>     * Each time you are going to implement a metric, see the dimension it fits and balance it with at least other 2 dimensions
>     * Although this is what the author recommends people usually couldn‚Äôt wrap about it
>
>     * Some people would pick bad metrics (i.e lines of code) and don‚Äôt pick other dimensions. In this case this is part of the ‚ÄúActivity Dimension‚Äù
>
> * Example: Working with a group to improve PRs
>
>     * Someone suggested pinging people every 15 minutes and measure the amount of alerts (I imagine if PRs were open)
>
>         * She knew from other literature that people would have alert fatigue
>
>         * People would tune out alerts
>
>         * So she kept this idea, but expanded the dimensions.
>
>         * So if we think about efficiency and flow, how much time would you have to work on your coding?
>
>         * This creates a balance. We need to protect time to work and pull to request review time at the same time
>
>     * For satisfaction metric sending a survey to eng team every few months can be a great way to measure it.
>         * Don‚Äôt discount what people say
>         * Sometimes she hear ‚Äúbut people lie‚Äù and she asks ‚Äúwhy would people lie? what is the incentive to lie?‚Äù
>         * Even with the most advanced instrumentation doing surveys is fundamental because you can get new insights
>
>     * Four boxes framework is a framework that she helps to pick metrics, you can read more in [the transcript](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/how-to-measure-and-improve-developer-productivity-nicole-forsgren-microsoft-research-github-goo/)
>
> üéØ **On Strategy**
>
> * ‚ÄúThe key to having a good strategy is knowing what not to do.‚Äù
>
>     * And the key to executing a good strategy is actually not doing it
>
>     * You can‚Äôt fund everything
>     * You don‚Äôt get to pick everything
>
> * She has a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wItAODkhZ-zKnnFbyDERCd8Hq2NQ03WPvCfigBQ5vpc/edit?usp=sharing) to help decide what to do next
