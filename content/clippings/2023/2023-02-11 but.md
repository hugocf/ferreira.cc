Read post “Your “but” is hurting me”

Also, probably inspired from the “yes, and” improv comedy technique, something I do for a long time is replace “but” for “and”. It forces me to rethink the phrase and tone.

An example with all the options above:

> ❌ Your design is great but the typography needs work.

> ✅ The typography needs work but your design is great.

> ✅ Your design is great. I think the typography needs work.

> ✅ Your design is great and with some work on the typography we can ship it.
