> Always remember these three guiding principles when choosing your share settings:
>
> 1. Share with the **fewest people and lowest level of access and permission** as the work allows. 
> 2. **Be aware of searchable settings** that may unintentionally share the file with others. 
> 3. If no longer needed, **reduce sharing permissions or delete files**.
>
> Combining these principles with an understanding of [Stanford’s risk classifications](https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/riskclassifications) will help you make the best sharing choices.
