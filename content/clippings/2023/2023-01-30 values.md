2023-01-30 values


> What makes a useful value?
> 
> 1. **Reversible**: it can be rewritten to have a different or opposite perspective without being nonsensical.
> 2. **Applicable**: it can be used to navigate complex, real scenarios, particularly when making tradeoffs.
> 3. **Honest**: it accurately describes real behavior.

> Some values I’ve found useful
> 
> * Create capacity (rather than capture it)
> * Default to vendors unless it’s our core competency
> * Follow existing patterns unless there’s an order of magnitude improvement
> * Optimize for the {whole, business unit, team}
> * Approach conflict with curiosity

> While reversibility and applicability are universal, you’ll have to evaluate for yourself whether these would be honest values for your company or organization.
