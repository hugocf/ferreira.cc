>>>The four kinds of Japanese space

**Relational space (wa)**

“We sat across from each other in the small room, which made the wa very tense and confrontational.”

**Knowledge-mobilizing space (ba)**

“Having all the different departments work on the project together meant things went slow, but the ba was great, and the breakthrough wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.”

**Location (tokoro)**

“Although they both loved camping, taking three flights to get there seemed like the wrong tokoro for a honeymoon”

**Negative space (ma)**

“The ma at this event is awful! There’s no time to think or breathe in between the presentations, networking, and meals.”
