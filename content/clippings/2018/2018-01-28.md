**“drawing with the same pen”**

> Let’s see how it looks:

> Black button with sharp font and a download icon with sharp corners, and a softer teal button with a round font and a download icon with softer corners
I call this “drawing with the same pen.” Each of these icons looks like it could basically be a character in the font used in the button. And that’s the point here. I’m not saying all icons will appear this way, but for an icon that appears inline with text like this, it’s a fantastic rule of thumb.
