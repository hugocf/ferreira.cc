Say what?! :thinking_face: 

>In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to software security that *adds rather than removes bugs in order to drown attackers* in a sea of enticing-looking but ultimately non-exploitable bugs. Our prototype, which is already capable of creating several kinds of non-exploitable bug and injecting them in the thousands into large, real-world software, rep- resents a new type of deceptive defense that wastes skilled attackersâ€™ most valuable resource: time. We believe that with further research, chaff bugs can be a valuable layer of defense that provides deterrence rather than simply mitigation.
