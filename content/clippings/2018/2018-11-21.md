Interesting concept of Data Rigidity:

> I have started to call this property of how complex it is to change the data schema of an application “Data Rigidity”.
> A Data Rigidity of 0 = no rigidity, or perfectly flexible application
> A Data Rigidity of 1 = a totally rigid and inflexible application.
