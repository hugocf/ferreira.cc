Comment from **[Dave Snowden]{.underline}**

> Another foolish dichotomy. It's not an either/or but a both/and


Comment from **[Dave Snowden]{.underline}**

> Any established practice has good and bad examples of use.
> Hierarchies are natural to human systems, but the ability to swap out of them (common in military) is vital; without profit there is no opportunity for purpose; In crisis or in many mission critical situations control is vital and empowerment irrelevant or dangerous; Privacy can give the space for risk taking that transparency prevents; planning is plain common sense.
> Over rigid and non flexible application of the left will mean a contextual loss of credibility, the same is true of all the stuff on the right.
> Context free assertions of dichotomies is one of the most dangerous aspects of Agile 'MindSET' populism at the moment.
> MindFLEX might be a lot better.
