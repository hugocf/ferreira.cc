> 1f y0u c4n r34d 7h15 y0u r34lly n33d 70 637 4 l1f3! (If you can read this you really need to get a life!) Well... Thank you... I guess? If you're like me, chances are you had no problem reading that sentence. I'm sure you'd agree it's a slightly insulting sentence to say the least. But the truth is most people struggle to understand what it's all about, if they're able to understand it at all. That’s why I thought it might be helpful to create this l33t sp34k ch34t sh33t (or leet speak cheat sheet!) that’ll help you cheat your way from n00b to l33t in no time.
