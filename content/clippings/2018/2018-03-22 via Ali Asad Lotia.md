> What are the pitfalls of running Java or JVM-based applications in containers? In this article, JÃ¶rg Schad and Ken Sipe discuss the challenges and solutions.

In short, set the following to automatically lock your min/max heap to half your container memory:

```
JAVA_OPTS=-XX:MaxRAMFraction=2 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap
```

Also, good explanation of the role of Linux kernel control groups (`cgroups`) and namespaces in containerisation.
