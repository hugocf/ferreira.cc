But they _are_ singularly about people!!! Está nas entrelinhas (*emphasis* added)

>And Facebook is truly the only company that’s singularly about people. Not about selling devices *but selling people*. Not about delivering goods *but delivering people’s info* with less friction. Not about entertaining you *but entertaining people*. Not about helping you find information *but helping you find people*. Just about people.
