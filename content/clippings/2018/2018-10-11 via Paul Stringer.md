TODO: Summarise the steps

https://equalexperts.slack.com/archives/C1G2EUEER/p1539198571000100

The TL;DR.. it works like this.

>1. Identify and define the problem quickly (e.g. We need to improve our sales flow.)
>2. Come up with a lot of solutions (often very creative solutions or really obvious ones that might have been overlooked)
>3. Find the best solution/next step, based on identifying the effort and impact of the best solutions
>4. Arrive at clear action steps (and their owners) that can start being implemented as soon as the meeting is over
