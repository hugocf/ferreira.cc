**The Expression Problem** (originally formulated by [Philip Wadler, 12 November 1998](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/expression/expression.txt)):

* The ability to extend our code by adding **new forms**: brand new implementations of current interfaces.
* The ability to extend our code by adding **new operations**: functionality represented as a new method in the interface.

OOP vs. FP trade offs to extend without changing existing code:

* OOP makes it easier to extend ****new forms****

* FP makes it easier to extend ****new operations****

Type Classes allow for extending both ****new forms**** and ****new operations**** without touching existing code
