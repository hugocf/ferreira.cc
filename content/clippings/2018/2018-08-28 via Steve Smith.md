> On the surface, the world of agile software development is bright, since it is now mainstream. But the reality is troubling, because much of what is done is faux-agile, disregarding agile's values and principles. 
> The three main challenges we should focus on are: 
> - fighting the Agile Industrial Complex and its habit of imposing process upon teams
> - raising the importance of technical excellence, and
> - organizing our teams around products (rather than projects).

## ## About the “Agile Industrial Complex” (Agile™ )

> If you want to succeed in doing software development, you need to find good people. You need to find good people that work together at a human level, so they can collaborate effectively. The choice of what tools they use or what process they should follow is second order.

> Ron Jeffries joked that Allistair Cockburn's approach to agile was "come together in peace and harmony, deliver software every week, and do a retro every time to figure out how you can improve".
> (…)
> What does matter is the notion of thinking about what we're doing and how we can do better, and it is the team that's doing the work that does this, that is the central thing.

> The point is, the team doing work decides how to do it. That is a fundamental agile principle. That even means if the team doesn't want to work in an agile way, then agile probably isn't appropriate in that context, and _[not using agile]_ is the most agile way they can do things in some kind of strangely twisted world of logic.

## ## About technical excellence

> When I summarize agile to people, I usually say there's two main pieces to it. One, I've already talked about, the primacy of the team, and the team's choices of how they do things, but the other is ****our ability to change rapidly, to be able to deal with change easily****.
> (…)
> But to do that you need software that's designed in a way that's able to react to that kind of change.

> Kent Beck summarizes this. "When you want to make a change, first, make the change easy. (Warning, this may be hard.) Then make the easy change".

> (…) refactoring is a constant thing. (…) Then, before you move on, in the words of Ward Cunningham: "You take the understanding out of your head and you put it into the code,": by restructuring it, by renaming it.

> Technical excellence is about being able to build that kind of adaptive software.

> Then a self-reinforcing principle comes in. Once you realize I can change software quickly to add new things, I don't try to make the software do everything I want it to do right at the beginning. (…) But that strategy is totally hopeless without good refactoring techniques. And then refactoring relies on testing, and refactoring also relies on continuous integration, and together with continuous integration, you have the practice of continuous delivery and the notion that we're gonna be able to release the software very, very frequently.

> "Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim. (…) One of the things that they demonstrate is releasing many times a day and low defect rates go together. Because you can't release many times a day unless you figure out how to get your defect rates down. That requires the kinds of practices we talk about: automated testing, refactoring, yagni - all of this stuff flows together. ****The most important thing about Extreme Programming is that the individual practices of Extreme Programming reinforce each other.****

## ## About products, not projects

> (…) instead of projects that you spin up, run for a while and then stop; you instead say, "Let's focus on things that are much more long-lasting and organize a product team around that."

Note: key notion is “long lasting” vs. “short term”

> (…) each of those teams needs to connect right the way through to the customer. Each team is focused on some aspect of the customer's experience, some aspect of what Kathy Sierra calls making the customer kick ass at what they do.

TL;DR

> So my three things, that we should face as challenges:
> - **Get rid of the Agile Industrial Complex and the idea of imposing stuff on teams**. Let teams work out the way they should work themselves.
> - **Raise the importance of technical excellence**, and never forget that when writing software, the technology side is really vital, and
> - **Organize around products**.
