> But I was suddenly seized by a horrible thought: what if this new-found agility was used, not teleologically to approach the right outcome over the course of a project, but simply to enshrine the right of middle management to change their minds, to provide a methodological license for arbitrary management?

> That, it suddenly seemed to me, was the likely outcome of using Agile tools in the absence of a governance regime to keep projects on target. Agile without governance is ‘headless Agile’, hence ‘acephalic’.

> The crucial point is that Agile itself provides us with the ability and opportunity to correct course, it allows us to steer, but it does nothing as such to help us steer correctly.

> Agile tools provide a _*steering mechanism_*, not a _*homing device_*.

> Everything hinges on the _*effective use of the control points in each sprint_*.
