> The code is written in TypeScript and runs on Node, using Atomist’s API. It benefits from excellent tooling and a rich module system. It’s unit testable. In short, it’s everything YAML and Bash are not.

> Atomist provides the framework for software delivery. It’s like Rails or Spring Boot for delivering your software.
>
> A complete platform for driving your software delivery from issue to commit to production deployment.

> Now with --local mode, use an SDM to streamline and automate your local development flow.
>
> Automate project creation, keep dependencies updated across projects, run your favorite linter. Anything you typically run on your own code can be added to your SDM and run on every commit. It’s your own private CI/CD.
