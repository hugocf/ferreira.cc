>>>Comparison and Overview

After the five different scope functions have been discussed, it’s necessary to see them all next to each other:

//return receiver T
fun T.also(block: (T) -> Unit): T //T exposed as it
fun T.apply(block: T.() -> Unit): T //T exposed as this
​
//return arbitrary value R
fun <T, R> T.let(block: (T) -> R): R //T exposed as it
fun <T, R> T.run(block: T.() -> R): R //T exposed as this
​
//return arbitrary value R, not an extension function
fun <T, R> with(receiver: T, block: T.() -> R): R //T exposed as this
The scope functions also and apply both return the receiver object after their execution. In apply, the block parameter is defined as a function literal with receiver and T gets exposed as this, whereas in also, it’s a regular function type and T gets exposed as it.

The scope functions let and run on the other hand both return an arbitrary result R, i.e. the result of the block itself. Again, run works with a function literal with receiver, whereas let uses the simple function type.

Last but not least, with is kind of a misfit amongst the scope functions since it’s not defined as an extension on T. It defines two parameters, one of which represents the receiver object of this scope function. Same as apply and run, with works with function literal with receiver.

returns receiver object	returns arbitrary result
exposed as `it`	`also`	`let`
exposed as `this`	`apply`	`run` & `with`1

1 Not an extension.
