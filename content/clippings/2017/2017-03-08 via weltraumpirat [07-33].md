@nargit I prefer Uncle Bob’s analogy: Writing the blueprint (as in: designing a house) is to an architect, what writing source code is to programmers. Building the house is done by the compiler. A software architect’s job is more analogous to what an urban planner does: Looking at the big picture, considering town-wide infrastructure, etc.
