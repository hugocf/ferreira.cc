Simple template for naming functions/methods (focused on calling readability):

<what‚Äôs it doing>[<what comes out>](params‚Ä¶)

<what‚Äôs it doing>
Action being performed. Prefer verbs focused on the output of the function and avoid generic or input-oriented ones (e.g. process).

<what comes out>
Because what goes in is easily seen in the function call, it becomes more useful to indicate in the name what is being produced (unless blatantly obvious from the verb alone).

Example:

‚õîÔ∏è `processStatus(events, rules)`

‚Ä¶ is actually lying ü§• since it is not _processing_ any status but rather the `events` and `rules` it receives.

‚ö†Ô∏è `processEventsWithRules(events, rules)`

‚Ä¶ is now accurate (albeit redundant; just `process` would suffice in this case) but tells us nothing about what _kind_ of processing it‚Äôs doing, nor about what it‚Äôs trying to produce. 

‚úÖ `chooseStatus(events, rules)`

‚Ä¶ accurately describes what the function is doing, with an ‚Äúoutput‚Äù focused verb (_choosing_), and what it produces (_status_). What it uses to make that choice (`events` and `rules`) is also easy to see from the function call, making this name the most complete and clear of the 3.
