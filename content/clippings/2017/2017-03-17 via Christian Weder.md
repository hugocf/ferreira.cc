Bookmark quote/lesson about how to weed out "takers" in the interview process @ **11:45**



> And my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question, &quotCan you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved?" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good. And let's face it, you all know you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver.
