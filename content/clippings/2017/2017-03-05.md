Having these **Isolated Tests** for every N layer:

1. State tests for its own logic
2. Collaboration tests against the Interfaces on layer N+1 to prove it can handle the answers
3. Contract tests on layer N+1 to prove it gives the right answers when asked the questions above

… will reduce and push the need for **Integrated Tests** to the base minimum, right to the thin outer layer on the edge of the outside “ugly” world (e.g. database, network, disk)

Note:
- Mocked expectations on (2) = Actions on (3)
- Stubbed answers on (2) = Assertions on (3)
