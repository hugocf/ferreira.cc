Good summary of the key essence and purpose of NoSQL databases:

> MongoDB is a document-oriented database that favors Consistency over Availability (CP). In many ways it is competitive with SQL databases.
CouchDB is a document-oriented database designed for multi-master replication and use in scenarios with inconsistent network access.
Cassandra is a column-store database that focuses on Availability over Consistency (AP). It provides relatively linear scaling over a large number of nodes.
Redis is fundamentally a Key-Value database with a some basic “data structure” features. Tools like Sorted Sets and Hash Sets are very nice, but they don’t really break the core mold of Key-Value.
