>>> Three Ways of DevOps can help organisations to succeed:

1. The First Way: The Principles of Flow – create a continuous *flow of value-add* from Development to Operations
2. The Second Way: The Principles of Feedback – create a constant *flow of feedback* from Operations to Development
3. The Third Way: The Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation – create a culture of *ever-increasing knowledge* within Development and Operations
