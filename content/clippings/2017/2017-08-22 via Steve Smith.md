The shapes of “complexity”

>Complexity
As a system scales, whether it is a manufacturing plant or a service like ours, the enemy is complexity. If you don't confront complexity in some way, it will eat you. However, complexity isn't a blob monster, it has four distinct heads.
		States. When there are many elements in the system and each can be in one of a large number of states, then figuring out what is going on and what you should do about it grows impossible.
		Interdependencies. When each element in the system can affect each other element in unpredictable ways, it's easy to induce harmonics and other non-linear responses, driving the system out of control.
		Uncertainty. When outside stresses on the system are unpredictable, the system never settles down to an equilibrium.
		Irreversibility. When the effects of decisions can't be predicted and they can't be easily undone, decisions grow prohibitively expensive.
