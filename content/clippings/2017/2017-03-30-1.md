>Affected queries a git repository for a commit range and determines which Go packages are affected, either because their source was modified or because they depend (directly or transitively) on an affected package. This is useful when working in a monorepo to speed up CI tests/builds and for reducing the number of components redeployed by a CD pipeline.
