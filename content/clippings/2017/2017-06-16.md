> Very, very true and one of our family's core values. When our kids make a mistake (and they're kids, so it happens frequently) we tell them, **”Don't tell me you're sorry and you won't do it again. Show us you're sorry and let your actions show us whether or not you'll do it again.”** Of course, we also apply the principle in positive ways with them too!
