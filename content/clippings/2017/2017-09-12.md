Alex Wilhelm, writing for TechCrunch, came up with a nice way to measure when a startup is not a startup.

I think that we can instead rely on the 50, 100 or 500 rule, which I just made up. Hereâ€™s the term sheet: If your company has, or is any of the following, you have to hang up your Startup Uniform, and realize that you are just another technology company either hunting for or actively avoiding an IPO:

$50 million revenue run rate (forward 12 months);
100 or more employees;
Worth more than $500 million, on paper or otherwise.
