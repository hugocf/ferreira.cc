TODO: Reword this into a good few bullet points because it comes from UX Forms’ Project Process (CLIENT SENSITIVE)

Good definition of agile in practice…

> High-level goals will be agreed as well as a shared understanding gained of the constraints of the particular project.

> Work will be agreed, card by card, with the client and we will **mutually and continuously flex scope, time and cost to meet our shared goals** within the project’s constraints.

> Bureaucratic overhead will be kept to the bare minimum to keep as much focus as possible on delivering working software.
