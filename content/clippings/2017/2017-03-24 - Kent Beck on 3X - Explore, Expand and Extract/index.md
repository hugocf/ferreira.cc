Update: very good quick summary to show others Kent Beck’s 3X — Explore, Expand, Extract | by RiverGlide | RiverGlide Ideas

If you’d like something to watch during the weekend :simple_smile: yesterday a saw this talk Kent Beck has been giving during last year and he’s model really got me thinking about how we do sw dev. I believe it could spark some interesting conversations amongst us:

As a simple Too-Long-Didn't-_Watch_ version summary…

In a sense it builds upon (or expands on) the concepts of Eric Ries “lean startup” (which Kent Beck alludes to at some point) applied to more technical matters instead of building companies/products.

As opposed to the common one-size-fits-all approaches (which he recognises his XP is also guilty of) it identifies 3 completely different realities of sw dev, with different sets of rules/concerns/needs, from a more _exploratory_ low-risk/high-reward nature, to a more _extract_ (as in “milking-the-cow”) high-risk/low-reward nature.

The key insight for me was the “fractal nature” of the s-curve pattern (as mentioned around the 1:06:20 mark), so you can look at it at different micro/macro levels

… i’ll be musing with these concepts for a while; maybe they might help to give some perspective to some nagging feelings i’ve been having in my current project about some things that didn’t feel like the right thing to be “TDDing”

… judging by the dates, i think i saw an earlier, less polished, version of the presentation, with some interesting side-commentary that didn’t made the cut on this one

[Comparing Explore, Expand, and Extract: Topics in 3X](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/comparing-explore-expand-and-extract-topics-in-3x/1241983035834558/)

> This note introduces and collects a series on topics, like estimation, testing, and team organization, compared across the three phases. Each note will also describe the transition between phases.

* Estimates

* Sequencing

* Teams

* Time

* Money

* Risk
* Economy

* Latency/throughput/variance

> So, yes, “limited capital” is a stupid blanket rule. So is “abundant capital”. Each, however, is a good rule in the right phase.

Genisis… be “beginning” post, equating “Explore/Expand/Extract” to “Triathlon”

gosto bastante deste modelo do Kent Beck

já tentei divulgar um pouco entre nós no escritório de lx mas não ganhou muita tração

partilhei aqui a minha opnião na altura qd vi a talk dele (outra gravação mas o mesmo conteúdo)

**este artigo do Medium tb é fixe… faz um bom resumo, com alguns gráficos, para quem queira um digest de 5–10 min.**

segundo o próprio, esta é a versão da talk que lhe correu melhor :simple_smile:

What to focus on…

* Explore:	Latency
* Expand:	Variance
* Extract:	Throughput
