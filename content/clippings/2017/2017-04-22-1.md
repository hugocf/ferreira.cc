> A def can be implemented by either of a def, a val, a lazy val or an object. So it's the most abstract form of defining a member.

and,

> The `val`s in question are in an Object, not a trait. Advice that would boil down to "don't use vals in Objects" pretty much equates to "don't use vals" which is obviously crazy. That's why this one bugged me so much. I think "don't use vals whose expressions depend on implicit resolution of other vals within the same object" is where I am winding up (reluctantly)

yeah, but it's for the same reason. The advice, "dont use val in trait" is on the premise that there are no valid use-cases (there are). The correct advice is, "understand scala well enough in this context to not make this mistake."
