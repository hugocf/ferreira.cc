John Allspaw (CTO of Etsy)'s masters thesis on heuristics when resolving outages is freely available and very interesting https://twitter.com/noahsussman/status/853641311106330625

Pretty much spot on, What change did we just make, What could have caused it, Occam's razor:

Three diagnostic heuristics were identified as being in use: a) initially look for correlation between
the behaviour and any recent changes made in the software, b) upon finding no correlation with a
software change, widen the search to any potential contributors imagined, and c) when choosing
a diagnostic direction, reduce it by focusing on the one that most easily comes to mind, either
because symptoms match those of a difficult-to-diagnose event in the past, or those of any recent
events.
