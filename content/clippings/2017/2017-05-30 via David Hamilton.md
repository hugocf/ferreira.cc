> Don’t confuse ****decoupling**** with ****distribution****. You can achieve decoupling by having a monolith, composed of well-defined modules, with well-defined interfaces, and you ****should****. You don’t need to ****distribute**** your application as separate services in order to benefit from the ****decoupling**** you get by having modules with clear interfaces.

> Remember, if you have a **DevOps Team**, then you are absolutely not doing DevOps. Developers should be involved in managing everything about their applications, including infrastructure.

> Martin Fowler wrote down his Microservice Prerequisites years ago (…):
1. Rapid provisioning
2. Basic monitoring
3. Rapid deployment
