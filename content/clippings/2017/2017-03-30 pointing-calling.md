> Japanese-innovated industrial safety method known as pointing-and-calling; a system that reduces workplace errors by up to 85 percent.

> Known in Japanese as *shisa kanko*, pointing-and-calling works on the principle of associating one’s tasks with physical movements and vocalizations to prevent errors …

> In the rail context, when train drivers wish to perform a required speed check, they do not simply glance at a display. Rather, the speedometer will be physically pointed at, with a call of “speed check, 80”—confirming the action taking place, and audibly confirming the correct speed.
