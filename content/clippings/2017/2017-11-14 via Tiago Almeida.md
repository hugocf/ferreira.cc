> News is to the mind what sugar is to the body

> Go without news. Cut it out completely. Go cold turkey.

> Society needs journalism – but in a different way.
> Investigative journalism is relevant in any society. We need more hard-core journalists digging into meaningful stories. We need reporting that polices our society and uncovers the truth. The best example is Watergate. But important findings don’t have to arrive in the form of news. Often, reporting is not time sensitive. Longish journal articles and books are fine forums for investigative journalism – and now that you’ve gone cold turkey on the news, you’ll have time to read them. ▪
