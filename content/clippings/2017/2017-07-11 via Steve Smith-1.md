> Technology can bring ****benefits**** if, and only if, it diminishes a **limitation*.*

>
> â€” Eli Goldratt

Key takeaways as 4 rules:

1. Understand the ****power**** of the new technology
	* What does it do? How does it work?
	* Will it work this way for you too?
	* How can we ****exploit**** this technology?
2. Recognise the **limitation** the technology will diminish
	* How could you ****prove**** the limitation was holding you back?
	* How would you know it was diminishing? What could you ****measure****?
	* What is your ****control group****? What if this is just a fluke?
3. Identify the **existing rules** we use to manage the limitation
	* How will they get in the way? What **assumptions** do they make?
	* Who owns the rules? Who might be **threatened** by dismantling them?
	* How do we make it ****safe to change****? How to create a ****graceful exit****?
4. Identify and implement the ****new rules****

	* How can we ****safely exploit**** this technology?
	* What **contraindications** should you be looking for?
	* How do we ****introduce**** and ****institutionalise**** these new rules?
