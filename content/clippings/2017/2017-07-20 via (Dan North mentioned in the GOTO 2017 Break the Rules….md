> It's "those skeptical people" who are most annoying. They don't seem to listen to our ideas. They usually start raising objections before we have even finished describing what we are thinking. They have a counterargument for every argument. What's to be done with "those people"? In this presentation, Linda will pull patterns from the Fearless Change collection plus the latest research in neuroscience to help you in the challenges you face with resistance.

TODO: List effective techniques… first draft:

1. Values (TODO: summarise the values the other might put more emphasis)
2. Trial run… let the other “experiment”
3. Listen… In silence (short responses are good)
4. Movement… Go for a walk together (i.e. same point of view; “moving” together)
5. Ask for help… An advice, favour, or loan; plays on the “cognitive dissonance” bias (we must be consistent/aligned with ourselves)
6. Stop the discussion… ask the question:*
*
> Is there something I can prove or demonstrate that would make you stop believing in it?
… but to yourself!
