Fantastic game theory simulation of how Trust evolves over time, with different players:

> “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” may be not just a moral truth, but also a mathematical truth. However… there's a problem!

—//—

> (…) three things we need for the evolution of trust:
>
> ****1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS****

>
> Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve.
>
> ****2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS****

>
> You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.
>
> ****3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION****

>
> If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.

—//—

> If there's one big takeaway from all of game theory, it's this: 
>
> ****What the game is, defines what the players do.****

>
> Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust, it's that our environment acts against the evolution of trust.
>
> That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. ****In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.****

>
> So, do what you can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust. ****Build relationships****. ****Find win-wins****. ****Communicate clearly****. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together… and learn… to live and let live.
