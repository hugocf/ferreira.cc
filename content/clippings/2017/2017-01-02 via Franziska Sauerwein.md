A thread no hacker news TV tem umas pérolas interessantes:

>I stumbled across the history of the ASCII "delete" character recently: It's character 127, which means it's 1111111 in binary. On paper tape, that translates into 7 holes, meaning any other character can be "deleted" on the tape by punching out its remaining holes.
