2017-03-12 Should vs. Must

+ link here to the IEFT’s(?) RFC defining the terms

>“Must” represents more of an obligation while “should” represents a probability or recommendation.

> (…) we can use all three verbs to express broadly similar meanings: the main distinctions between them are related to degrees of emphasis.

Must is the most emphatic: you use it when you’re confident about a conclusion, or when you want to stress that it’s very important for someone to follow your recommendations. You also use must to refer to something that’s required by a rule or law.

Ought is less strong than must, and isn’t used to talk about things that are compulsory. It often carries with it slightly more forcefulness and more of a sense of moral obligation or appropriateness than should.

Should is the least forceful of the trio: it’s mostly used to make suggestions and more tentative predictions.
