1/e-law: Let 
τ
\tau  be such that 
F
(
τ
)
=
1
/
e
.
F(\tau )=1/e. Consider the strategy to wait and observe all applicants up to time 
τ
\tau  and then to select, if possible, the first candidate after time 
τ
\tau  which is better than all preceding ones. Then this strategy, called 1/e-strategy, has the following properties:

The 1/e-strategy

(i) yields for all 
N
N a success probability of at least 1/e,
(ii) is the unique strategy guaranteeing this lower success probability bound 1/e, and the bound is optimal,
(iii) selects, if there is at least one applicant, none at all with probability exactly 1/e.
