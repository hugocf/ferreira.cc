Crossfit vs. MovNat

>There is some, in that both are functional movement systems, meaning that both avoid isolated muscle movement in favor of multi-joint whole body movement. There is a difference in model, though. Crossfit follows the GPP (general physical preparedness) model which means that the goal of training is to be as fit as possible for as many activities as possible. MovNat follows the SAID (specific adaptation to imposed demands) model. The idea behind that is that humans get better at whatever we do on a regular basis. So for MovNat we practice practical skills that have real world application. As we develop skill, we get fitter. As we get fitter, we can develop more skill. For instance, a Crossfit practitioner will practice pull-ups to be more fit. A MovNat person will practice pull-ups as part of a sequence of climbing onto something (a practical movement with real world application) which in turn will make them fit at the same time. I hope this makes sense.
