> There is a paper called [“The Humble Programmer”](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361591), and even though it was written in 1972, after all these years it is still super-relevant.
> (…)
> We don't have the mental power to keep on top of every new innovation and idea. Mental power is our most precious resource.
> 
> Part of this is being able to leverage the **power of abstraction**—focusing on what is important and leaving out the unnecessary details.
> 
>The whole point of "The Humble Programmer" is that your brainpower is your most limited resource, so using smart tools is a good thing.

> *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. That book gives you really complete ways of thinking about human relationships and how you interact with other people. It is written in a way that makes you consider the lessons by putting yourself in other people's shoes.

> (…) focus at the *intersection of theory and practice*. There is no progress without friction.
>
> It is easy to dive into theory, or all the way into just practice—but the real interesting work happens between theory and practice. Try to understand both sides. The safe spot is to retreat to one of the extremes.
>
> Going back to "The Humble Programmer," understand that you can't keep up with all of the knowledge that is produced.

> My thinking has two main sources of inspiration: the military and the hacker way. ([U.S. Marine Corps. 1997. **Warfighting*]*(http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCDP%201%20Warfighting.pdf)) ([Zuckerberg, M. 2012. *"the hacker way"*](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/))
>
> So how do you deal with uncertainty? When people attempt to solve with process, they are trying to fight or control uncertainty.
>
> Being agile is about communication. The process needs to change with the situation. You have to have a big picture of where you want to go, but any plan or process will shatter immediately when you hit your first bug or something happens out of your control.

*(about common mistakes)*

> Your prior assumptions are not higher order—that is, you are not making assumptions about your assumptions. I keep reading **How to Win Friends**… because I understand it is easy to fall back into my default behavior.
