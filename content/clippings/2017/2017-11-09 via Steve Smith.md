> The incentives send a clear message: business performance is not the responsibility of a cost center.

> Being in a cost center can be demoralizing. You aren’t on the A team that brings in revenue, you’re on the B team that consumes resources.

> What kind of mitigating circumstances might help IT escape the cost center trap?
>
> 1. There is serious competition from startups.

startups = profit centers

> 2. IT is recognized as a strategic business driver.

“outside contractor” ≠ strategic business driver

> 3. A serious IT failure has had a huge impact on business results.

share the pain => share the gain

> To summarize, the cost center trap and the capitalization dilemma both create a chain reaction:
> 1. Accounting drives metrics.
>    ⇩
> 2. Metrics drive culture.
>    ⇩
> 3. Culture eats process for lunch.

> ****Beware of Proxies****
>
> “A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. ****But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing****. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. **You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right.** Gulp.”
>
> Here are some common proxies we find in software development:
> 
> - **Accounting metrics** are proxies, and not very good ones at that, because they encourage local sub-optimization. 
> - **Project metrics** – cost, schedule, and scope – are proxies. Worse, these proxies are rarely validated against actual outcomes.  
> - **“The Business”** is a proxy for customers. Generally speaking, so is the product owner.
>
> (…) make a habit of **measuring what really matters** - skip the proxies and focus on outcomes and impact.
