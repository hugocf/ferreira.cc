Interesting modelling concept about how focusing on **remediation** of incidents is essential to achieve your reliability goals.

> We can talk abstractly about how more remediations reduce the defect rate of future changes, but in reality there is probably one specific remediation that would reduce your future defect rate by 90%, and to identify it you have to review the root causes of your most frequent incidents.
