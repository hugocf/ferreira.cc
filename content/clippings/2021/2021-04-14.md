I’ve been asked many times before about **standing desks**, so here’s a version clipped together from the different conversations I’ve had over time, in case it’s useful to others.

My standing desk is a fixed table and quite big (2 m x 80 cm). It’s the chair that is taller than normal. I picked it up from my former employee (who was closing the office to go remote-first) and you can see it here: https://springernature.slack.com/archives/C01PDB5LQMT/p1614383277084500

There are two types of standing desks that I see being recommended quite often. Some people I know are quite happy with them:

* Jarvis, by Fully: https://www.fully.com/en-eu/standing-desks/jarvis.html
* SmartDesk 2, by Autonomous: https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks

Feedback a former colleague of mine shared regarding the Jarvis one:

> First impressions from Jarvis: ultra stable, fast going up and down, good quality of details and the assembly in also easy

Then you also have some more budget options in IKEA (SKARSTA? BEKANT?) but I don’t really have any personal references for them.

I found this video quite some time ago that has very good advice in what to look for in a standing desk, from practical and real usage of standings desks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZi903mkis0  *(you have many, many reviews on YouTube about any specific models you think about buying)*

One thing you should pay close attention to is the degree of oscillation/wobbling the table has when fully extended in standing mode — that was one of the main reasons why I chose the “fixed standing desk + tall chair” combo.

Hope it helps :+1: Fell free to add your suggestions and experience in the thread if you have further tips :thread:
