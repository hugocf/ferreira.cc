Steps to create a fully formed idea

> * Define a goal — something that nearly everyone in your audience wants.
> * Introduce a problem that people don’t know they have.
> * Discover a truth that makes inaction impossible, because it puts the goal in jeopardy.
> * Define the change they will make as a result of that truth.
Turn the change into action that accomplishes the goal . . . and does much more, too.
>
> These answers, taken together, generate a story.

**Problem**

> … best formulated as a “two-part problem” — highlighting parts of reality that are in conflict: “a pair of words or short phrases that complement each other and/or have a relationship that the audience would readily acknowledge and understand.”

**Truth**

> “It’s often a belief, value, or assumption that is so core to who you are — it just seems so obvious to you — that it never occurs to you to articulate it.

** Change**

> “You can’t create change in someone else, only the conditions for it. Change comes from choice; choice comes from conflict.”
