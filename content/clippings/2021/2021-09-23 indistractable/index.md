## 1. Manage Internal Triggers

> Time management is pain management.
>
> — Nir Eyal

### Strategies

* Identify the feeling or thought behind your urge — “find the internal trigger”
* Write it down — “keep a log of distractions”
* Explore the sensation — “get curious”

### Techniques

* Surf the urge with the “10 minute rule”
	* “give in to any distraction in 10 minutes and bring awareness to it in the meantime”
	* “get curious about the sensation until it passes, like a wave”

## 2. Make Time for Traction

> You can’t call something a “distraction” unless you know what it’s distracting you from.
>
> — Nir Eyal

### Strategies

* Plan the time (the input), not the output — “schedule your days”
* Get rid of low-value work — “offload it [to automation] and make time for more traction in our day”
* Spend less time communicating and more time concentrating — “creative problem solving … requires concentration time”

### Techniques

1. Don’t pick your goals, pick your values
2. Turn your values into time
3. Timebox your schedule

> People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time, they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.

## 3. Hack Back External Triggers

> The time you plan to waste, is not wasted time.
> 
> — [Dorothy Parker](https://www.nirandfar.com/timeboxing/)

### Strategies

* Ask “Is [this] trigger serving me?”
* Adjust notifications
* Leave distracting devices out of meetings

### Techniques

1. Remove apps you don’t need
2. Replace where and when you use distracting apps (phone ➔ desktop)
3. Rearrange distracting apps out of sight
	* Unclutter your laptop desktop and smarphone home screen
4. Reclaim and adjust your notifications
	* Use your smart phone Do Not Disturb feature

## 4. Prevent Distraction With Pacts

> This technique has to come last. … utilise only after you've done the other three. If you don't do this in the proper order, you will fail.
>
> — Nir Eyal

### Strategies

* Use tech to block distactions
* But be careful, when you fail:
	* “have self-compassion to yourself”
	* “talk like you would talk with a friend”

### Techniques

* Effort pact — “involves increasing the amount of effort required to do something you don’t want to do”
* Price pact — “puts money on the line. If you stick to your intended behavior, you keep the cash. If you get distracted, you forfeit your funds”
* Identity pact — “empower yourself to make decisions based on who you believe you are”
