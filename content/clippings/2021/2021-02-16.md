> **Agile** is a philosophy, a mindset; **Agility** the resulting behaviour and capability. It’s all about being able to react to change and insights and delivery value early.
>
> The **approach** chosen to orchestrate the process from analysis to design, delivery and operation can be **iterative** or **linear** (waterfall) approach. Agile methodologies are based on iterative approaches, but a team using a linear approach can still get some value from agile principles. Though full agility can never be achieved without an iterative approach.
>
> **Scrum** is a a methodology within the agile space (as is XP), while classic Prince2 is in the waterfall space.
>
> **Kanban** is a system to schedule work. It can be used within various methodologies, even within Scrum. But Scrum by default uses **Sprints**. Kanban is ‘continuous’, while Sprints are ‘iterations’ with beginning and end.
