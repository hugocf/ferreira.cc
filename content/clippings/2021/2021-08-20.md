> The principles of lean are:
>
> 1. Eliminate waste
> 2. Amplify learning
> 3. Decide as late as possible
> 4. Deliver as fast as possible
> 5. Empower the team
> * people with the knowledge make the decisions
> 6. Build integrity in
> * integrity is not just quality, it's also adaptability to change
> 7. See the whole
> * don't optimise pieces at the expense of the whole (put all metrics one level above the area you want to optimise)
