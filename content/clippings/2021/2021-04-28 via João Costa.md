> Hello, Joe,
> VERSUS
> Hello Joe,
>
> The first addresses the recipient. The second uses “hello” to modify “Joe.” Have you ever heard of a “hello Joe?”
>
> This is different than “Dear Joe,”.
>
> The reason for this is that Dear Joe actually is an adjective to describe Joe. You are not greeting Joe in the same way you are when you say “hello.”
