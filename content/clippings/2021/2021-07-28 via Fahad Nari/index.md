Interesting idea for flexible teams organisation.

> * Team Captain - leading the overall effort
> * Product Lead -  leading product strategies and resonance with audience
> * Delivery Lead - leading delivery and execution
> * Craft Lead - leading on technical direction in a specific craft area

> Lastly, we devised a list of 36 generic responsibilities we believed a leadership team should embody (see Appendix for the full list of responsibilities). 11 of these responsibilities were anchored to specific roles in order to define their overall essence. … Beyond that, responsibilities remained fluid to better cater to Rioters’ individual skills, competencies, and growth areas. The remaining 25 responsibilities were left up to the team to delegate.
