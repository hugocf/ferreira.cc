Although to deal with backlogs or broken process I prefer the approach: “how to get out of a hole? stop digging!”, i.e.

1.	Force every new thing coming in to fit with fixed process (catalogued, classified, triaged, whatever)
2.	Consider everything before it as “backlog” and move it out of the way (it's there for reference/search if needed — it hardly ever is)
