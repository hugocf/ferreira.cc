List of patterns that make technical writing confusing, and how to avoid them.

> Here’s a quick index of all of them. They’re not in any particular order.
>
> pattern 1: making outdated assumptions about the audience’s knowledge
> pattern 2: having inconsistent expectations of the reader’s knowledge
> pattern 3: strained analogies
> pattern 4: pretty pictures on confusing explanations
> pattern 5: unrealistic examples
> pattern 6: jargon that doesn’t mean anything
> pattern 7: missing key information
> pattern 8: introducing too many concepts at a time
> pattern 9: starting out abstract
> pattern 10: unsupported statements
> pattern 11: no examples
> pattern 12: explaining the “wrong” way to do something without saying it’s wrong

* TODO: Copy links for each of the above patterns
