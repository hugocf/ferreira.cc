"Life Karma Dicussion  (Misc.)"
https://us.teamblind.com/s/0VCkNnB8

I don't believe in God but Karma makes sense to me from a sociological and evolutionary perspective (e.g. “what goes around, comes around” and things like that).

Karma is a long game though. It's a network effect you build along many years and decades. It's about you overall posture in life regarding what you believe is right, not something you do to get an immediate benefit.

Good and bad things happen all the time. It's your choice which ones you attach yourself to and focus on.
