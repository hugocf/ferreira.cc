Nice write up of the “nursery story” about how incentives can backfire and the slippery slope of metrics and numbers: human interactions are complex, subjective and very nuanced.

See also the “Cobra effect”
TODO: link to other clipping?

> What had happened is that previously the parents understood that there was a social compact. You collected your children on-time because it was bad manners, if nothing else, not to. Now the Nursery had put a price on it. The fine was the fee for looking after your children for longer. The Nursery had removed the social incentive for doing the right thing and replaced it with a financial one that described how much it cost to do the wrong thing. Parents decided to pay for the extra child-care!
