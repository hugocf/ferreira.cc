Seneca studied [Cato’s](https://dailystoic.com/cato/). Cato studied [Cato the Elder’s](https://dailystoic.com/what-you-can-learn-from-this-towering-roman/), who happened to be in the crowd when Stoicism was first introduced to Rome from Greece by Diogenes. Diogenes studied in Athens under [Chrysippus](https://dailystoic.com/chrysippus/). Chryssipus studied [Cleanthes](https://dailystoic.com/cleanthes/) and Cleathes studied [Zeno](https://dailystoic.com/zeno/) and Zeno studied Socrates, who we could call the godfather of the Stoics.
