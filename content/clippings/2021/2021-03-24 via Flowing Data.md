> The next three parts of this series provide you with a “decision tree” – a Choose Your Own Adventure of data vis – by asking three questions:

> * Part 3: If you decided to use a quantitative color scale – when should you use a sequential and when a diverging one?
> * Part 4: If you decided to use a quantitative color scale – when should you use a classed and when an unclassed one?
