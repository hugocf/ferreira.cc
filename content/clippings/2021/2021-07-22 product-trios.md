Excellent advice from Teresa Torres about how analysis and research fits in [stream-aligned teams](link to team topologies clipping):
https://youtu.be/HHYeKxlRV1Y?t=230


Patterns to use:


> Product teams work on a faster cadence. We don't have time for perfect research and that's okay. **We're trying to mitigate risk not seek truth.**


> User researchers need to understand that **product teams** work under the constraint that they **need fast answers to daily questions**, they need to be able to **test an assumption in a day or two, not weeks**.
>
> Good user researchers understand this and are able to **balance the science of longer horizon research with the art of quick and dirty assumption testing.**


Anti-patterns to avoid:


> **Don't let your user researchers become the gatekeeper to your customers.** I've worked with far too many teams who waste weeks spinning their wheels waiting on research from the user research team. Instead they could have used that time to run less than perfect assumption tests, which are more than adequate for discovering and shipping customer value.


Key takeaways:


> Longer horizon research is fundamentally different from discovery research. It's not a pitting these methods against each other. We need both.

> A product trio is typically comprised of a product manager, a designer, and an engineer working together to make decision about what to build.

FYI about the sentence I've mentioned during our retro *(btw, the whole video is worth watching; it's only ~5 min long)*:


> Product teams work on a faster cadence. We don't have time for perfect research and that's okay. **We're trying to mitigate risk not seek truth.**
