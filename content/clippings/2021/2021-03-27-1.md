TODO: Make it a thoughts post about the incubating feature flag

> If “both”? you are on a journey into exponential complexity growth as you add more flags – Flag “A” on Flag “B” on, Flag “A” on Flag “B” off, and so on! This is a never-ending game that you can’t win in any definitive way.

My current company has an interesting approach to this where there is only 1 feature flag called “incubating features”. You either turn it on (and are exposed to everything that is incubating) or off (and have the experience live users do).

When I joined them was quite surprised since I had always only worked with separate flags per feature, like you describe above.

It’s working quite well for us and, in practice, I'm finding it much simpler and easier to work with than separate flags:

• No combinatory effect
• Immediate integration of all features in progress and very early detection of clashes
• Easy for everyone to see and use what is in progress: it’s just one well known flag
• Impossible to forget to take functionality from behind the feature flag — that’s the only way to release it to all users (turning on a ff in live and not doing the code removal *was* a pattern I've fought against many times in the past in other places)
• We use code level annotations to mark each usage of the feature flag in the code with what functionality it belongs to, so we can easily leverage the compiler to find its usage when it's time to remove it
