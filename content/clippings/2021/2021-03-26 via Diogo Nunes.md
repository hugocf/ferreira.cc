Interesting tool for email automated testing:

> Mapil is an email testing service for developers and QA teams. You send us an email, we'll store it and let you query it using our API.

> **Why did you build this?**
> 
> Almost all web systems send emails, whether it be automated reports, transactional emails, or promotional messages. Often times these messages need to be functionally tested as part of the QA process. We found that it was prohibitively difficult to check the contents of an email, so we built Mapil.
