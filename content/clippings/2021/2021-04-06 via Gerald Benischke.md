> A security.txt file is a way for websites to show how security researchers can get in contact and whether there is any bug bounty or vulnerability disclosure policy.
>
> This website scans the top 250 sites daily (you are viewing top sites in United States currently) for their security.txt file and parses it.
> You can also [query](https://gotsecuritytxt.com/query) any website to see if there is a security.txt file and whether it appears to be formatted correctly.
