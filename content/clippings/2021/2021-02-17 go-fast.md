# 2021-02-17 go-fast


Key principles to follow:

> Get things clear

> Start writing software and iterate quickly

Practices that work well together and will help up go fast:

> **Rules and principles**
>
> • 1 Small co-located team
> • Pair programming most of the time
> • No branches and no pull requests
> • Have a minimal deployment pipeline
> • Continuously deliver to live on green builds.
> • Write tests
> • Monolith, not microservices
> • Don't design up front
> • Refactor continuously
> • Avoid writing an SPA, embrace progressive enhancement
> • Don't obsess over pixel-perfect design
> • Ship the first 80%, polish it later
> • The people who write the software are the ones that are on support for it
> • Use mature, proven tools
> • It must be simple to build the software
> • If the build is red, stop
> • Actually sit with users and watch them work
> • User stories are a conversation starter
> • Understand that <em>we are all software developers</em>
> • Have 10/20% time
> • Don't plan extensively beyond 6 weeks
> • No Jira worship, no estimates, no timekeeping, no burn-up charts
> • Keep work-in-progress (WIP) low
