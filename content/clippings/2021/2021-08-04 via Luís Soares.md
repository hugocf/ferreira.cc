> Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. … It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:
>
> * If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.
> * If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a _simple sound-powered phone_.
> * If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.
> * If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!

> Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime
>
> 1. Proficiency takes less time.
> 2. Troubleshooting takes less time.
> 3. More alternative solutions.**
**

> Principles for Simple Systems
>
> 1. Features don’t justify complexity.
> 2. Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.
> 3. Modifications before additions.
