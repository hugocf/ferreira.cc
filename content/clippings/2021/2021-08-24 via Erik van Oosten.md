What if programming could be done without “files” and directly in a “git-like” environment? 🤔

> Now, if there is one big technical idea behind Unison, explored in pursuit of the overall goal of making programming better, it's this: **Unison definitions are identified by content**. Each Unison definition is some syntax tree, and by hashing this tree in a way that incorporates the hashes of all that definition's dependencies, we obtain the Unison hash which uniquely identifies that definition. This is the basis for some serious improvements to the programmer experience: it eliminates builds and most dependency conflicts, allows for easy dynamic deployment of code, typed durable storage, and lots more.
