> The **“Frontend/Backend”** axis doesn’t map well to engineers’ motivations.  … Instead, try using the **“Product/Infrastructure”** axis as the first axis to understand your career preference.

> Broadly speaking, there are 2 types of engineers[^2]:
>
> 1. “Product-first” engineers are obsessed with using code to solve a user problem and they see code as just a means to an end.
> 2. “Code-first” engineers are obsessed with the abstractions, architecture, tools and libraries in the code. Elegant code is the end.
>
> [^2]: I took the “code-first” vs. “product-first” engineer terminology from Xoogler Zach Lloyd’s blog: https://thezbook.com/ ↩︎

> The “Frontend/Backend” division is still a valuable axis. However, using the “Frontend/Backend” in isolation of “Product/Infra” in project selection can lead to engineer-job Mismatch. Especially amongst Product engineers.

> At the end of the day, engineering is multifaceted and can be defined along more than one axis: B2B vs. B2C, B2B top-down vs. B2B “bottom-up”, API-first vs. application-first, “Forward deployed” vs. “Software engineer”, etc.
