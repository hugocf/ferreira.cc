Basic principle: think about how you would describe the image to a person who can’t see it, mentioning **what is relevant** to the content. 

> **Write Good Alt Text**
> 
> * Add alt text all non-decorative images.
> * Keep it short and descriptive, like a tweet.
> * Don’t include “image of” or “photo of”.
> * Leave alt text blank if the image is purely decorative
> * It's not necessary to add text in the Title field. 

Also, details and examples about some techniques:

> * Technique: Describing graphs
> * Technique: Text and images of text
> * Technique: Using diagrams to illustrate text
> * Technique: Writing alternative text
