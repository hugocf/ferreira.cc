# 2021-04-03 autonomous-engineers


Summary of the key points:

> 1. Autonomy for software engineers
> 2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources
> 3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency
> 4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics
> 5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication
> 6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience
> 7. Higher leverage --> higher {autonomy, pay}

Enough said:

> "SV-like" companies think of engineers as value generators, and creative problem solvers. Traditional companies think of them as factory workers.
