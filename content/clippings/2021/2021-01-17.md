Nice video with good advices about standing desks.


TODO: video embed here


Having used standing desks for roughly 5 years now (since early 2016) the best combo for me is **fixed tall desk** + **tall chair**:


* It's the most solid solution, with no wobble at all
* Switch from sitting to standing is super fast (just get out of the chair)


TODO: add image of my standing desk? IMG_3169.jpg + crop the door out + erase pictures of the children


For extensible desks, I know people who are very happy with and recommend the following:


* **Jarvis**, by Fully: https://www.fully.com/en-eu/standing-desks/jarvis.html
* **SmartDesk 2**, by Autonomous: https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks


*Note: There are also budget solutions in IKEA some people vouch for but I haven't had any experience with tem (some are mentioned in the video above)*


Be sure to pay attention to possible table wobble in the standing position. It's something that can kill the standing working experience if it's is not solid enough for you to lean on it at will.
