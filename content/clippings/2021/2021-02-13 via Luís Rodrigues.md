Architectural **Patterns** ≠ Architectural **Styles**

Patterns:
> … describe something inside a single system or component
* CQRS
* Transaction Script
* Event Sourcing

Styles:
> … describe a system of systems (or a system of many components …)
* Service Oriented Architecture
* Event Driven Architecture

Architectural patterns and *not* architectural styles.

> This is very important to understand most architectural patterns are not good to apply everywhere. … The largest failure I see from people using event sourcing is that they try to use it everywhere.
