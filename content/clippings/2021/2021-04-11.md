Interesting formulation of something similar I've been independently defining as the following source streams of work:

1. User needs
2. Team needs
3. Company needs

> **User asks (40%)** - our largest chunk of work goes directly towards users asks (as prioritized by users, baselines and timeframes). Our biggest bucket of work is immediately improving our users lives.

>
> **Platform quality (30%)** - maintaining our current and future baselines. This is also our budget to reduce toil in operating our systems. This isn’t the only time we prioritize baseline work, sometimes those baselines are user asks as well, this is instead the minimum amount of time we spend shoring up the baselines.

>
> **Key initiatives (30%)** - each half we select one to three very large projects at the engineering “group” level (in this case, a bit over one hundred engineers) that solve an entire category of user asks or provide a generational leap in hitting our baselines. We scope the projects to what we can finish in six months; then we finish that work in six months. This protects our ability to innovate, while avoiding never-ending projects.
