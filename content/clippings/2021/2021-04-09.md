Very interesting approach to the technical career path, without slipping into “management”.

> The Staff-plus sequence of titles decouples seniority from archetype and is more durable for it.

> You can assess someone’s seniority from their title: Staff engineer, Principal engineer, Distinguished engineer, perhaps with some varieties like Senior Staff engineer thrown in for very large organizations.

> You can separately understand someone’s mode of operation by documenting someone’s [archetype](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes): solver, architect, tech lead, or right hand.

> For each archetype, you'll find folks who love it and find it deeply rewarding, along with folks who find the work despair-inspiring. While it's important to aim towards an archetype that fits you well, it's also worth remembering that over your thirty or forty-year career, you'll have long enough to spend some time sampling every archetype.
