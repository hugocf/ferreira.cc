Has anyone come up with a satisfactory answer to keeping hold of all of their personal data? I’ve been mulling over how to keep track of it all. E.g. content posted to facebook/twitter - is there a good way of either authoring locally and keeping that record and then sharing, or going the other way and syncing everything back to your own personal data store?
I’ve found https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html#mypkg and https://hyfen.net/memex/, but they all seem deeply hacky. And going the other way with something like micropub doesn’t seem to have gained any traction.
There *must* be some fancy startup somewhere that’s tackling this exact problem, surely?

“Own Your Data” is something that's been under my radar for many many years now but as an eternally postponed project. See examples of how others are doing it in the IndieWeb wiki: https://indieweb.org/own_your_data (edited)

I’m mostly jotting down and clipping interesting things I find into offline notes to publish “one day” 😅

I've actually started building such a personal “data hub” with Hugo and looking to publish via Netlify (generous free plan for a personal site + custom pipeline automation)

I'm going for the “author locally + shared widely” because it seems simpler and nowadays I hardly comment or write on social media anyway (and on the rare occasion that I do, either it's discardable crap or I manually copy it locally and link to that post)

In the “author locally” part, to help with the content conversion of the multiple storages I've had over the years (before I started writing only in Markdown) Pandoc looks promising

And for the “shared widely” bit, all of the saas services I've tried were either not flexible enough for what wanted or too expensive (e.g. Buffer, IFTTT, Zapier, Microsoft Flow, etc.) and I'm looking to one day test drive Node-RED (low code, open source, akin to the Yahoo Pipes of old) to see if that fits de balance between flexibility and no time available to fiddle around too much 🙂

 — there's also an interesting offering starting on top of Node-RED called FlowForge

*(now if you know how to get 48h-days for all this, let me know)* 😈
