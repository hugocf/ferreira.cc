Stop just using “Frontend” or “Backend” to describe the Engineering you like | by Michelle Lim | Medium

> … “code-first” programmers – are obsessed with how code is architected, what tools, libraries and languages are used, how much test coverage there is – stuff like that. … That is, they love the code they write – the code is the thing.
>
> The product-first programmer cares about that stuff too, kind of, but only as a means to an end. For product-first programmers, the code is the scaffolding, the support, the steel beams in the building, but not the end product. … what matters to them is how well that product actually solves the underlying problem. … Product-first programmers love building and launching and seeing users use what they’ve built. The product is the thing

> Programming is about building products that solve problems for users not about writing beautiful code for its own sake.
>
> … whether your users are external customers, third-party developers, or internal consumers of an API. What matters is how the code works, not how the code looks.
>
> Does that mean that I encourage writing bad code? That I don’t care about what technology we use or how the software is architected? Absolutely not – I care a lot! But I care because I believe if you make the right engineering choices, you will ultimately get to a better product.

> ****If the product doesn’t work well, the code is not good.****

> There’s no zero sum game here: you should strive for good code, produced quickly, leading to great product. This is what great programmers produce.

> The best programmers I know are product-first, but actually have more coding knowledge than the coding-first programmers. They know when to use the chainsaw vs the hand saw vs the chisel.
