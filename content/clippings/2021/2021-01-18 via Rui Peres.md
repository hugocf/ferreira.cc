> Many people make the Fool's Choice in crucial conversations when they believe they have to make unpalatable either/or choices, for instance, 1) choose between telling the truth about a problem vs. 2) staying silent to preserve a relationship with a boss, coworker, or loved one.


Formula to bring the other person into a mutually aligned conversation:


> - State what you want.
> - State what you don't want.
> - Combine the first and the second via and and into a question.


For example, "How can we make sure [the benefit] happens and [the drawback] doesn't occur?"
