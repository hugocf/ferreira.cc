Kent Beck on ones live purpose:

> My mission: help geeks feels safe in the world. Everything I’ve done fits somehow:

> Your mission … the whole picture only came into focus after decades of detailed work. That’s what I’d recommend to you if you’re beginning your career (you know, the first decade or two)
>
> Once you have enough puzzle pieces, then you can arrange and rearrange them and see what picture pops up.
