Dealing with frustration and anger:

> • Labeling negative emotions reduces their impact.
> • Recognizing the coping stance into which you’ve retreated in the moment provides a way to label the negative emotion.
> • Venting frustration as anger tends to cause us to cling to that anger, rather than letting it go.
> • Inhabiting the coping stance provides a way to help you feel the corresponding feelings in a way that promotes letting them go sooner.
