* Bad thing: no easy UI

> Browserosaurus is an open-source (GPLv3 license), browser prompter for macOS. It works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links in non-browser apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where you are presented with a menu of all your installed browsers. You may now decide which app you’d like to continue opening the link with.

* Good thing: simply and nice UI
* Bad thing: no automatic rules (mitigation, use together with Finicky https://github.com/will-stone/browserosaurus/discussions/476)
