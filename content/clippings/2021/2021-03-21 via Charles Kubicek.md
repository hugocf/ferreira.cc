**## > **Moving up the autonomy ladder****
>
> It’s important to remember that most of the time that autonomy is misaligned is because people aren’t quite sure what is expected for the situation or that trust hasn’t yet been built.
>
> When this happens, to help leaders and teams move up the autonomy ladder to where they need to be, make small shifts rather than giant leaps by asking these key questions:
>
> 1. **Who decides the work?** Move from manager giving teams specific tasks to asking them how they would break things down.
> 2. **Who generates the options?** Move from manager telling teams to execute a solution to bringing problems to the team and asking them for options to solve (along with estimates on effort etc.).
> 3. **Who selects the right option?** Move from manager deciding which option to pursue to giving team clear guidance on criteria and trade-offs so that they can self select
> 4. **Who identifies the problems?** Move from manager looking for problems to bring to the team to the team identifying problems themselves and asking for prioritisation.
> 5. **Who prioritises?** Move from manager prioritising to giving the team clear prioritisation criteria so they can self select.
> 6. **Who removes constraints?** Move from team escalating blockers outside their control (time, budget, staffing etc.) to team being able to directly challenge or remove them themselves. E.g. re-organise their own team, manage their own budgets.
