[The perfect pricing model doesn't exist - by Matt Hodges](https://wrap-text.equals.com/p/the-perfect-pricing-model)

> **You'll never be done**

> â€¦
>
> At the end of the day, there's no silver bullet when it comes to pricing. There are just many things you can and should probably test. Be ready to make trade-offs â€“ whether thatâ€™s knowingly leaving money on the table or being OK with fewer customers who pay you more.
>
> Make peace with the fact that your pricing will never be perfect.

> **So, what is pricing (+ packaging) anyway?**
>
> â€¦ align on what you mean when you use certain words. So, *pricing* and *packaging*. Two words. Two sides of the same coin.
>
> ðŸ’° **Pricing**: How, and how much, customers pay
>
> ðŸ“¦ **Packaging**: How and what customers can buy

---

> **Pricing is a strategy**
>
> If you treat pricing and packaging as a strategy and not just a box you need to tick, it can create step changes in growth for your company.
