[The deadline doom loop - by James Hawkins](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/the-deadline-doom-loop)

> Here’s how the loop plays out:
> 
> [Phase 1: “We’re gonna make it!” 👍](#§phase-were-gonna-make-it)  
> [Phase 2: “Are we gonna make it?” 🤷](#§phase-are-we-gonna-make-it)  
> [Phase 3: “We’re not gonna make it!” 🥵](#§phase-were-not-gonna-make-it)  
> [Phase 4: “We (sort of) made it.” 😵‍💫](#§phase-we-sort-of-made-it)  
> [Phase 5: “We’re gonna make it this time!” 🙏](#§phase-were-gonna-make-it-this-time)

> **Principles for escaping the doom loop**
>
> The alternative, an approach that helps us ship faster, relies on a few key principles:
>
> 1. **Small product teams** – Ideally, six or fewer. A team of six [cracked engineers](https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto) will ship faster than a team twice its size. Small teams = less coordination, fewer meetings, and more time coding – see [The magic of small engineering teams](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/the-magic-of-small-engineering-teams).
> 2. **Engineers make product decisions** – [Product engineers who own product decisions](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/product-management-is-broken-engineers) ship faster and better. This approach attracts ambitious, talented engineers with an intrinsic motivation for building great products.
> 3. **Trust and feedback over process** – Autonomy is more important than control. We expect people to give each other constructive feedback, and be generous with their praise when it’s deserved. Small teams make this easier, too.

> **Things you need to make this work**
> 
> 1. **Be clear about what you need from people**
>
> … [provide guidance]
>
> How do you know the team are doing this? What process do we implement?
>
> None!
>
> The moment you implement a process to do so, you're re-creating the doom loop you’re trying to avoid. Resist your urge to “[trust, but verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify)”.
>
> "Trust and feedback over process" is key here. We want our team to push each other on the above.

> 2. **Set a high bar for hiring**
>
> This is vital.
>
> We expect a wider skillset from our engineers than just writing code, so we hire people that have wider skills. This means lots of ex-founders, ex-CTOs that just want to build stuff, and people with more experience.
