> The **Karpman drama triangle** is a social model of human interaction proposed by San Francisco psychiatrist, Stephen B. Karpman in 1968. The triangle maps a type of destructive interaction that can occur among people in conflict. … The triangle of actors in the drama are **persecutors**, **victims**, and **rescuers**.

> Karpman described how in some cases these roles were not undertaken in an honest manner to resolve the presenting problem, but rather were used fluidly and switched between by the actors in a way that achieved unconscious goals and agendas.

> One of the fundamental differences between the **Victim** orientation and the **Creator** one is where you put the **focus of your attention**. For Victims, the focus is always on what they don’t want: the problems that seem constantly to multiply in their lives. They don’t want the person, condition, or circumstance they consider to be their villain.
> 
> Creators, on the other hand, **place their focus on what they DO want**. Doing this, Creators still face and solve problems in the course of creating the outcomes they want.
