> The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:
>
> * **Technology**: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
> * **System**: level of ownership of the system(s)
> * **People**: relationship with the team(s)
> * **Process**: level of engagement with the development process
> * **Influence**: scope of influence of the position
>
> The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.
