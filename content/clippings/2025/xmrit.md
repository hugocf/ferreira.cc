[What is this? | Xmrit](https://xmrit.com/about/)

> Xmrit (pronounced *‘xam-mer-it’*) is a free tool by [Commoncog](https://commoncog.com/) to help business operators quickly create and share XmR charts.

> An XmR chart helps you analyse your data. In a sentence: it helps you separate signal from noise. It is particularly useful to business operators.
>
> …
>
> XmR charts are so named because they consist of an ‘X’ chart (the ‘X’ variable, or the metric you care about), and a ‘Moving Range’ chart, which shows differences from point to point.
>
> **Rule 1: Process Limit Rule**
>
> Rule one states that if a point lies outside the limit lines (the blue lines), on either the X chart or the MR chart, *something unusual is going on*.
>
> **Rule 2: Quartile Limit Rule**
>
> Rule two states that if you have a run of three out of four successive points that is closer to the limit lines (blue dotted lines) than the centre line (red dotted line), then this is a *moderate* source of exceptional variation and you should investigate.
>
> **Rule 3: Runs of Eight**
>
> Rule three states that if you have data points in a row on one side of the average (red) line, this is a *weak* source of special variation and you should investigate.
