> FTD is probably Follow the Dopamine, complete a task then keep that momentum going.

> Almost got all the acronyms! I couldn't figure out three, though. Here they are:
> Blitz - focus on purpose
> HF - helper function
> DND - do not disturb (mode)
> FTD - follow the dopamine
> M - mindfulness
> PMR - progressive muscle relaxation
> B - breathing
> R.A.I.N. - recognize, accept, investigate, non-judgment
> EA - ??? (Essential/efficient/effective action?)
> BD - ??? (Break down?)
> NTS - name the steps
> JS - ??? (Jumpstart? Just start? Javascript? Lol)
> RT - random task
> KT - kill task
> OA - order assigned
> OD - order due

> RAIN is also such a win. And I appreciate the reminder this Thursday in a coffee shop when I'm wrestling something.
> JS is indeed Just Start.
> BD is body doubling.
> EA is lost to time.
> If I could add a new one it would be "Mar the Canvas" aka mess up on purpose at the beginning to defeat perfectionism.
