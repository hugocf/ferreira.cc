>>> Using fear, shame, disgust, or shock to create a sense of urgency is a classic we tool in the er back pocket. And it totally works for gaining the attention of potential first-time buyers.

>>> Campbell nailed down the structure that has worked for countless fairy tales, novels, and adventure movies. He called this storytelling cheat sheet the "monomyth" or "Hero's Journey."Here's what Campbell had to say about the monomyth:
*The usual hero adventure begins with someone from whom something has been taken, or who feels there is something lacking in the normal experience available or permitted to the members of society. The person then takes off on a series of adventures beyond the ordinary, either to recover what has been lost or to discover some life-giving elixir. It's usually a cycle, a coming and a returning."*
