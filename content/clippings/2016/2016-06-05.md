PragDave: Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)



*(not just for software development... it's for life!)*

> Back to the Basics
>
> Here is how to do something in an agile fashion:
>
> What to do:
>
> Find out where you are
> Take a small step towards your goal
> Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
> Repeat
>
> How to do it:
>
> When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.
>
> And that's it.


Better yet...


> No Rules Are **Universal**

> All Rules Need **Context**



**> Get feedback, refine, repeat**
