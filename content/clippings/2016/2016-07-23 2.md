Testing the UI or Testing Through the UI?


If my WebDriver check is testing a JavaScript feature creates HTML at runtime then I am Testing the UI which means cross-browser testing is valid.
If my WebDriver check is testing a form submission to ensure my data is being stored correctly then I am Testing through the UI which means cross-browser testing is invalid.
I use this question to avoid the cross browser anti-pattern and only run the checks that test the UI across different browser. The other checks I would only run against one browser, or better still, as suggested by Richard, push those checks down to a lower level.
