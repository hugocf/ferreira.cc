And regarding UML, I see great value in it but in the direction code -> diagram.

It's so much better/easier/faster to reason about code structure using a visual representation of the *actual usage* relationships between classes, but so frustrating to be unable to *easily* do it with the push of a button in the Java/Scala land.

(found a hacky way around it just a few weeks ago but the results just… meh 😞)

That’s generally true *only* for visual thinkers. Many people are visual thinkers, but not everybody, not even most people.

(I’m not a visual thinker. I’m an aural thinker)

Don’t make the mistake of assuming that everyone thinks the same way.

I'm not assuming that. I'm talking from my past experience of working with good RAD tools (code generation; meta-languages, if you will) and seen the effects on teams of having dashboards like this, auto-updated daily from real code snapshots

*(not advocating such tools though; wouldn't have come to EE if I was happy with them and thought they were the solution)*

For people that think the way I think, diagrams don’t add a ton of value. They mostly add value for me when communicating (usually with visual thinkers) as an additional way of specifying things to make sure everybody really means the same thing.

Diagrams also have significant drawbacks. Like any documentation, they can lie… in fact, every diagram lies after enough time passes. But even when they are current, there’s a strong tendency for people to confuse the map with the terrain, so to speak.

Because of that, I tend to destroy diagrams at the end of every conversation.

Remember, we value “working software over comprehensive documentation”. Diagrams are documentation.
