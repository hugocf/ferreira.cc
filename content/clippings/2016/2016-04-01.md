> Laughter does not scale. It's a lesson we're all learning, along with all the other horrible lessons that come from living on the crumbling cliff of the network. If you do things online, when someone tells you, "that's not funny," well, they're right.
> But what does scale?
> Culturally---Star Wars, action movies in general, simple stories of redemption, romantic comedies, pornography, political news and arguments, anything related to sports, especially soccer, etc. Apple and Microsoft's brands. Google's brand. Anything related to food and cooking and eating. There is a very big, broad, global culture that can be teased out by looking at popular magazines or the sections of a big newspaper. Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Brad Pitt, Kardashians---these things regularly hit hundreds of millions of people and don't implode under the pressure and actually profit WILDLY from the attention.
