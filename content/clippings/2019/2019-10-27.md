The raise of psychological safety, it's growth, and the fall into the “Psychological Safety”™ disgrace: a blueprint for how well meaning concepts develop, their terms get abused, commercialised, and eventually fall into irrelevance.

> I fully expect the **term** *psychological safety* to follow the same progression that “agile software development” followed before it.
