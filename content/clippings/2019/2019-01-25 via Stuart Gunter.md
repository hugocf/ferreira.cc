> **Record and share your terminal sessions, the right way.**
>
> Forget screen recording apps and blurry video. Enjoy a lightweight, purely text-based approach to terminal recording.
>
> *Simple recording*
> Record right where you work - in a terminal. To start just run `asciinema rec`, to finish hit `Ctrl-D` or type exit.
>
> *Copy & paste*
> Any time you see a command you'd like to try in your own terminal just pause the player and copy-paste the content you want. It's just a text after all!
>
> *Embedding*
> Easily embed an asciicast player in your blog post, project documentation page or in your conference talk slides.
