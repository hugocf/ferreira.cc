> 1. “People like us make our money in the seams of things”
> The idea behind 100:10:1 is simple:
> • Brainstorm 100 things that could go wrong
> • Pick 10 on that list that feel like the most likely and investigate them
> • Find the 1 critical problem you’re going to focus on.

> 2. “Know what people are asking you to be an expert in”
> “You didn’t trick anyone, we know who we hired”

> 3. “Before you can make things better, you have to stop making them worse”

Reminds me [“the first step out of hole is to stop digging”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_holes)

> 4. “To go left, turn right”
> The Taoist advice of not moving in any direction before looking for and considering the opposite path

> 5. “Thinking is also work”
