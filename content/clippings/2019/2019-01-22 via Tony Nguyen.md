Example for Equal Experts, pitching to a business: 

> You know how you seem to spend a lot of money on expensive consultants, but you don’t seem to get the expertise that you pay for or the outcomes you expect?
>
> Well what we do is make sure we keep our entry bar high, and ensure all our associates are experts in their field with a minimum of 10 years experience. There are no grads here! Our clients know they are always getting a team with real expertise.
>
> In fact, We’ve just recently just hit 10 years old as a consulting business by not following the traditional consulting path.”
