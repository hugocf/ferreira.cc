Rule of thumb about implement workflowish Lambda functions, between just doing it in code vs. AWS solutions (i.e. Step Functions or Express Workflows)

> If you’re seeking practical advice, I’d say the breakeven is when you have more than 3 “things to do” in a function, especially if they involve other AWS services: Less than that, and just writing the code and avoiding the use of another service is probably best. More than that, and you’re getting to the point where your function is dominated by a workflow, and separating the choreography from the computational logic starts to sound like a good 12-factorish separation of concerns.
