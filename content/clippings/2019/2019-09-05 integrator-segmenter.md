Segmenter:


> * I draw a hard line between my career and my non-work roles, and I don't want to mix them. When I'm on the clock, I'm focused on my job, so that I don't have to think about sending any late-night emails once I'm done for the day.


Integrator:


> * I like having the freedom to blend my work life and non-work life, and move back and forth between the two as needed. I'm at my best when I can be flexible --- taking a work call after dinner seems like a fair trade to be able to run an errand during work hours.
