> In January of 2019 we launched the On-call Compensation Survey, which aimed to surface how compensation for on-call is being applied across the Tech/IT sector. Thanks to the 300+ people who responded, we have a dataset which we hope will make it easy for those who manage on-call to make better decisions, and for those who are on-call to have something to cite when asking to be compensated fairly.
