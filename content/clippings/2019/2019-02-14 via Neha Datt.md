TODO: Clip only the “Mutual Learning mindset”? That’s the one I usually referred back to when having to populate the interview feedback form

> **Mutual Learning mindset:**
>
> The Mutual Learning values
>
> - Transparency
> - Curiosity
> - Informed Choice
> - Accountability
> - Compassion
>
> The Mutual Learning assumptions
>
> - I have information and so do other people
> - People may disagree with me and still have pure motives
> - I may be contributing to the problem
> - Each of us sees things others don’t
> - Differences are opportunities for learning
>
> **Mutual Learning behaviors:**
>
> - State views and ask genuine questions
> - Share all relevant information
> - Use specific examples and agree on what important words mean
> - Explain reasoning and intent
> - Focus on interests, not positions
> - Test assumptions and inferences
> - Jointly design next steps
> - Discuss undiscussable issues
>
> **Mutual Learning results:**
>
> - Shorter implementation times
> - Increased commitment
> - Higher quality decisions
> - Increased learning
> - Improved working relationships
> - Greater personal satisfaction and well-being
