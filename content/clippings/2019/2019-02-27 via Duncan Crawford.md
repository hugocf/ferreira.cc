> (…) the underlying problems, which come down to the interplay of three critical factors, only two of which you can directly control:
> 
> - **Fragility** — the impact of new changes. If a new feature affects only one part of the machine, it’s easy to test and implement; if it affects all parts of the machine, testing becomes more critical and difficult, and implementation takes an order of magnitude longer.
> - **Work size** — the minimum unit of work that can be achieved by a team and be considered a productive feature. “Pay with Alexa”, for example, not “Meet to discuss when to implement Pay with Alexa”.
> - **Complexity** — how much knowledge is needed to implement a feature. Can a developer who knows how to write a feature independently do the same in the organization? What extra steps need to happen that silently slow progress without adding any customer value to the output?

With “serverless” (i.e. using as many managed services as possible):

> - Fragility is reduced thanks to zero infrastructure management and loose coupling. In our projects, we have seen our code base shrink, up to 10 times smaller in some cases.
> - Work size tends to hover around feature size because it’s trivial to create new function versions or entirely new functions that weren’t needed before.
> - Complexity doesn’t impact the developer — if she can write a function that handles a credit card payment, it will be almost the same code in a serverless app without organizational wrappers and environmental factors slowing down the work.
