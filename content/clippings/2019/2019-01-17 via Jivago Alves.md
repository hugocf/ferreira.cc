Easy and simple way to record decisions, saved in version control together with the source code (GitHub excellent web interface makes it quite friendly for non-tech users).

Bite sized collection of records for "architecturally significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.
