NVC = Non-Violent Communication

> When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because I’m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]?
>
> 1. Observations vs. Evaluations
> *An observation is something that you actually saw or heard in the past. Our brains are hardwired to take raw information and instantly make up a simple story*
> *An easy way to check whether you’ve made an observation or an evaluation is to ask yourself, ‘What did I actually see or hear?’*
> 2. Emotions vs. Thoughts
> *If you can substitute ‘I feel’ with ‘I think’ and the phrase still works, it’s a thought, not an emotion.*
> 3. Universal needs vs. Strategies
> *As soon as you include ‘from you’ in the need statement, it stops being universal.*
> 4. Requests vs. Demands
> a) Make it specific.
> b) Say what you want, not what you don’t want.
> c) Stay curious

> **The 40-Word Rule**
> During difficult conversations, it’s important to be extremely concise.
> It’s also worth noting the importance of having these conversations face-to-face. NVC loses some of its power when it’s in an email.

Take responsibility for your feelings instead of blaming others. 

> “We accept responsibility for our feelings, rather than blame other people, by acknowledging our own needs, desires, expectations, values or thoughts.”
>
> For example, when I say, “You hurt my feelings when you didn’t call me back right away, ” I attribute my hurt feelings to the other person’s behavior.
>
> However, when I say, “I was hurt when you didn’t call me back right away, because I really wanted to plan to get together tonight,” I attribute my hurt feelings to my unfulfilled desire to get together.
>
> An important NVC concept is that the more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for other to respond in a compassionate manner.
