Don't assume stuff about the world, but if you have to guess, these are great guidelines to follow!


> Rules of thumb for a fact-based world view 🗺 👁



1.  📈 Most things improve
2.  🐪 One hump *(i.e. most people are in the middle)*
3.  🙋‍♀️ First social, then rich *(i.e. the majority already have this)*
4.  🦈 Sharks kill very, very few
