Good round up about web api versioning…

> Fortunately, there are things you can do up front when designing your API to maximize the number of changes that can be made in a backwards-compatible way. One example is using PATCH instead of PUT for updates. You can also add a couple of random and meaningless properties to every entity representation; this will test the clients' ability to ignore future properties they haven't seen before.

Strong argument for “don't do it” and instead deliberately design the api to be backwards compatible…

… and a case for using `Accept-Version` header for versioning

My take? Don't version, only extend *[link to Rich Hickey talk about not versioning]**; uses no host if a terraform/rebuild the world change is needed

How?
- PATCH => update only what's needed
- Random keys => force reading only what's needed
- New fields only => keep backwards compatibility: customers: ["",""] + customersDetails: [{},{}]
- Start with objects => allow extensibility: X ["",""] –> V {"":["",""]}
- Rebuild api = New site => allow for clean starts: if it changed so much, it's a new thing `mercury.example.com/some/resource` vs. `venus.example.com/some/resource`
