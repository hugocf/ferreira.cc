Concurrency is about structure.
Parallelism is about execution.

> **Concurrency** Programming as the composition of independently executing processes. _(Processes in the general sense, not Linux processes. Famously hard to define.)_

> **Parallelism** Programming as the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.

**## > **Concurrency vs. parallelism****
> Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
> Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
> Not the same, but related.
> Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution.
> Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.
