> * Shift your thinking from High Lines of Code to Low lines of Code
> * Shift your thinking from Building Services to Consuming Services
> * Shift your thinking from Owning Workloads to Disowning Workloads
> * No instances, servers or containers unless there is no other way
> * Scaling up and down to zero should be handled by a service as much a possible
> * Data Layers should be application specific — no “one size fits all” approaches
> * Minimise your long term effort, even (especially?) at the expense of short term effort
> * Observability first development aka Working backwards not forwards
> * No new services or technologies without a valid business case
> * All technologists in a business are there to provide business value
