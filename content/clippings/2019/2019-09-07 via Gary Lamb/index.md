TODO: Reduce this text ðŸ‘‡

> Hi everyone... ever wondered why some workshops just 'work' while others don't? @Francois Botha and I have given it some thought and reduced it to a base 'formula'. The idea is that if any one of these 'variables' within the formula are lacking/missing/diluted, the result will be sub-optimal. For example, if you're missing at least one participant who is really good at probing and challenging, you're likely to miss the difficult and/or insightful conversations.
