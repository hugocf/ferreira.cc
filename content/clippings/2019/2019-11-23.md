> There’s an old story, usually attributed to David Ogilvy, about a copywriter whose daily walk to work takes him past a blind beggar on a street corner. His sign reads, “I’M BLIND. PLEASE HELP.” Every day, the beggar is largely ignored by the passers-by. One sunny morning, the copywriter stops, takes out a marker pen and scribbles three words on the sign, then moves on. From that day, the blind man’s cup is stuffed with notes and overflowing with change. The copywriter has adapted the sign to read: “IT’S SPRING AND I’M BLIND. PLEASE HELP.”

or then again, maybe not:

> Here is the Prévert story (using a poem by American poet David Kirby as the source):
> Prévert saw a beggar who had a sign that said "Blind Man Without a Pension."
> Prévert asked him how it was going.
> The beggar replied …
> "Oh, very badly. People pass by and drop nothing in my hat, the swine."
> Prévert took the sign from him and altered it.
> A few days later, he went up to the beggar and again asked him how things were going.
> The beggar said, "Fantastic! My hat fills up three times a day."
> Prévert had written the following on the beggar's sign:
> "Spring is coming, but I won't see it."
