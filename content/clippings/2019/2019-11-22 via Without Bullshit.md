> Effective writing creates a change in the reader. Whether you’re writing an email, a blog post, or a strategy document, four elements determine your success: Reader, Objective, Action, and iMpression. I use the (slightly skewed) acronym ROAM to keep all four in mind as I write.

> * Readers: Who is the audience?
> * Objective: What are you trying to do?
> * Action: What do you want the readers to do?
> * iMpression: What will they think of you?
