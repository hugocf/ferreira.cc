There’s more to “root causes” than what meets the eye!

> So, ask the question “Why,” but use the answers with care. Don’t assume you will only encounter problems that can be reduced to a simple single chain of causality where the best intervention lies at the start of the chain.  Be open to the possibility that you are dealing with a causal network that has multiple starting points and endpoints. You might even consider adding a few more questions to your toolkit:
>
> • Why do I think the root cause is the best place to fix this problem?
> • Why do I think I should only intervene at a single location?
> • Why do I think the best intervention point will remain static?
> • What other important causes and effects are entering and exiting my causal chain?
