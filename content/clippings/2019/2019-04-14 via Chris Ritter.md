>>> (â€¦) this package is designed with the enterprise client in mind: providing a backwards compatible, systematic means of:

Preventing new secrets from entering the code base,
Detecting if such preventions are explicitly bypassed, and
Providing a checklist of secrets to roll, and migrate off to a more secure storage.
