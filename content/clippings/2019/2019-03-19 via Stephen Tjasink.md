> Brexit as a waterfall project:  The contractor is insisting on working to their own interpretation of a vaguely worded specification that is three years out of date.  They are insisting that no change can be accepted to this specification despite representatives of the client telling them that their requirements have changed, many of the original management team have left and some have been charged with fraud.  Contracts with subcontractors and partners are not yet signed and the project is way behind schedule.  But the contractor insists that the only way to deliver to the specification is to continue with the same "plan".  All the while, the client is paying for it.
