I’d like to quickly call out some of my values.

Give a shit. Care about what you do. Own it end to end. If you don’t care about what you do here, please find a place where you do, for all our sakes. Life is too short.

**Deliver value, not code.** We are not here to write code, deliver sprints, tickets, story points, even to run experiments. (…)

**Challenge everything.** This applies both in the context of your direct team (…) and our organization as a whole. (…)

**Tell it like it is.** Don’t sugar coat, #BeOpen. No PR bullshit.

Actions speak louder than words. Don’t just complain, do something. (…)

**Celebrate the good.** It is often easy to drown in the darkness of reality. (…)
