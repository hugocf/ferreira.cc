[SOLID (object-oriented
design)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design))

A mnemonic acronym introduced by [Robert C.
Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin "Robert C. Martin")
in the early 2000s:

-   **S** : [Single responsibility
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle "Single responsibility principle")
    --- "an
    [object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)")
    should have only a single responsibility."
-   **O** : [Open/closed
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle "Open/closed principle")
    --- "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for
    modification."
-   **L** : [Liskov substitution
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle "Liskov substitution principle")
    --- "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of
    their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
    (see  also [design by
    contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract "Design by contract")
    )
-   **I** : [Interface segregation
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle "Interface segregation principle")
    --- "many client specific interfaces are better than one general
    purpose interface."
-   **D** : [Dependency inversion
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle "Dependency inversion principle")
    --- "one should depend upon abstractions, not depend upon
    concretions." (e.g. [dependency
    injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection "Dependency injection")
    )
