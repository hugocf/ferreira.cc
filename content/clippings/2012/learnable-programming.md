[Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)

> -   **Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill.** Learning
>     about "for" loops is not learning to program, any more than
>     learning about pencils is learning to draw.
> -   **People understand what they can see.** If a programmer cannot
>     see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.

Excellent essay about programming "without blindfolds".
