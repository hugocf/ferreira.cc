[Skeuomorphism & Storytelling / Tobias Bjerrome
Ahlin](http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/skeumorphism-and-storytelling/)

> It is often said that design should be invisible. More importantly,
> design should empower. An interface that is not only easy to use, but
> fun to use, engages the user and creates an experience where obstacles
> are easier to overcome, and thus an experience where the product is
> easier and more effortless to use. Done right, skeuomorphism can
> retain the simplicity and ease of use of an interface while empowering
> users to act.

[skeuomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph)

> ... a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues to a
> structure that was necessary in the original.
