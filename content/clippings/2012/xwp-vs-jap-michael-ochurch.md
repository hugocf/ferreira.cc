> Enter the "X.W.P." distinction, which is the alternative to being a
> "J.A.P." \[Just A Programmer\] It means an "X Who Programs", where X
> might be an entrepreneur, a researcher, a data scientist, a security
> specialist, a quant, or possibly even a manager. If you're an XWP, you
> can program, and quite possibly full-time, but you have an additional
> credibility that is rooted in something other than software
> engineering.
