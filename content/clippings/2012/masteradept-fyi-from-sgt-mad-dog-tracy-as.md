> FYI -- from Sgt. Mad Dog Tracy -- As the Chalk Leader for my flight
> home from Afghanistan, I witnessed the following: When we were on our
> way back from Afghanistan, we flew out of Baghram Air Field. We went
> through customs at BAF, full body scanners (no groping), had all of
> our bags searched, the whole nine yards. Our first stop was Shannon,
> Ireland to refuel. After that, we had to stop at Indianapolis, Indiana
> to drop off about 100 folks from the Indiana National Guard. That's
> where the stupid started. First, everyone was forced to get off the
> plane-even though the plane wasn't refueling again. All 330 people got
> off that plane, rather than let the 100 people from the ING get off.
> We were filed from the plane to a holding area. No vending machines,
> no means of escape. Only a male/female latrine. It's probably
> important to mention that we were ALL carrying weapons. Everyone was
> carrying an M4 Carbine (rifle) and some, like me, were also carrying
> an M9 pistol. Oh, and our gunners had M-240B machine guns. Of course,
> the weapons weren't loaded. And we had been cleared of all ammo well
> before we even got to customs at Baghram, then AGAIN at customs. The
> TSA personnel at the airport seriously considered making us unload all
> of the baggage from the SECURE cargo hold to have it re-inspected.
> Keep in mind, this cargo had been unpacked, inspected piece by piece
> by U.S. Customs officials, resealed and had bomb-sniffing dogs give it
> a one-hour run through. After two hours of sitting in this holding
> area, the TSA decided not to re-inspect our Cargo-just to inspect us
> again: Soldiers on the way home from war, who had already been
> inspected, re-inspected and kept in a SECURE holding area for 2 hours.
> Ok, whatever. So we lined up to go through security AGAIN. This is
> probably another good time to remind you all that all of us were
> carrying actual assault rifles, and some of us were also carrying
> pistols. So we're in line, going through one at a time. One of our
> Soldiers had his Gerber multi-tool. TSA confiscated it. Kind of
> ridiculous, but it gets better. A few minutes later, a guy empties his
> pockets and has a pair of nail clippers. Nail clippers. TSA informs
> the Soldier that they're going to confiscate his nail clippers. The
> conversation went something like this:
>
> TSA Guy: You can't take those on the plane.
>
> Soldier: What? I've had them since we left country.
>
> TSA Guy: You're not suppose to have them.
>
> Soldier: Why?
>
> TSA Guy: They can be used as a weapon.
>
> Soldier: [touches butt stock of the rifle] But this actually is a
> weapon. And I'm allowed to take it on.
>
> TSA Guy: Yeah but you can't use it to take over the plane. You don't
> have bullets.
>
> Soldier: And I can take over the plane with nail clippers?
>
> TSA Guy: [awkward silence]
>
> Me: Dude, just give him your F\*\*K\*\*G nail clippers so we can get
> the F\*\*K out of here. I'll buy you a new set.
>
> Soldier: \[hands nail clippers to TSA guy, makes it through security\]
>
> To top it off, the TSA demanded we all be swabbed for "explosive
> residue" detection. Everyone failed, [go figure, we just came home
> from a war zone], because we tested positive for "Gun Powder
> Residue". Who the Hell is hiring these people? This might be a good
> time to remind everyone that approximately 233 people re-boarded that
> plane with assault rifles, pistols, and machine guns-but nothing that
> could have been used as a weapon. **Can someone please tell what
> the hell happened to OUR country while we were gone?**
