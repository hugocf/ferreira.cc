> The slightly painful truth is, **at any one time there is only one
> piece of real estate we can "own" in another person's mind.** People
> can't think of us as a project manager, professor, attorney, insurance
> agent, editor and entrepreneur all at exactly the same time. They may
> all be true about us but people can only think of us as one thing
> first. **At any one time there is only one phrase that can follow our
> name.**

> Being able to do many things is important in many jobs today. Broad
> understanding also is a must. But developing greater discernment about
> **what is distinctive about us** can be a great advantage.
