> (...) I discovered the **Multiple Reading Process (MRP)** , which

> 1.  **Pre-Reading**
>     -   **General Overview** -- Look over the document for features,
>         layout, and structure of the material.
>     -   **Preview** -- Quickly glance through the document and
>         identify key concepts, categories and new ideas related to the
>         purpose of your reading.
> 2.  **Actual Reading** : Read the material and fill in the gaps
>     between the pieces you found in the Preview.
> 3.  **Postview** : Complete a [Slash Recall

>     and then refer back to the source material to fill in any blanks
>     in your diagram.
