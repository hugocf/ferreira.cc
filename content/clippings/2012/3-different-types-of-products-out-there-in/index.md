> (...) 3 different types of products out there:
>
> In the first case, we have something like purchasing food. Immediately
> that hamburger has a lot of value (you're hungry right?) but after you
> eat it, the value is largely gone.
>
> In the second case, there are products that deliver the same amount of
> value to you every day. A newspaper subscription is a great example of
> this. Every day it shows up at your door and you get the same value
> from it each time.
>
> In the final case, you see a product whose value increases over time.
> On day one, you haven't invested much time into it and you probably
> don't even understand how it helps you. However, as you use it more
> and more and put more into it, the value because increasingly clear.
> Services like Dropbox and Evernote are perfect examples of this.
