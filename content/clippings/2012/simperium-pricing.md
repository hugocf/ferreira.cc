[Simperium -- Pricing](https://simperium.com/pricing/)

> All plans include unlimited sending and storage of structured data
> plus access to Simperium libraries for iOS/OSX, Javascript, Python and
> Ruby.

What is it:

> Simperium is a service for developers to move data everywhere it's
> needed, instantly and automatically.
>
> Use a Simperium library and write a few lines of code. Simperium can
> then move any JSON data across multiple versions of your app and your
> backend services.
>
> Our hosted service manages persistence, security, conflicts, scaling,
> versioning, and backups.
>
> With full offline support, Simperium instantly moves changes at the
> first available opportunity. Only data that changes gets sent, so it's
> fast and efficient.
>
> Simperium can move data to and from your own backend services to give
> you complete control.
