> The Gro-clock, priced at £39.99, uses fun images of the sun and the
> moon to let them know just when it's acceptable to go bounding out of
> bed to terrorise parents.
>
> The clock comes with a bedtime story book (to encourage more time in
> bed no doubt), and features include: adjustable screen brightness,
> optional digital clock and alarm feature, and stars that go out one by
> one during the night to show the passing of time.

Good ideia!
