[Never say "no," but rarely say "yes."](http://blog.asmartbear.com/how-to-say-yes.html)

> So the principle is easy: **Set the conditions of "yes" such that:**
>
> 1.  **If they say "yes," you're happy** because the terms or money are
>     so good, it more than compensates for the distraction, possibly
>     even funding the thing you really want to do.
> 2.  **If they say "no," you're happy** because it wasn't a great fit
>     anyway, so it's not worthwhile for a small return on your time and
>     effort.
>
> So that's the punch-line, but before you go I'd like to over-emphasize
> **the idea of "funding the thing you really want to do."**
>
> This can take many forms, but it's the single best way of figuring out
> how to qualify your "yes." Examples:
>
> -   "Yes" if it pays for an entire additional person.
> -   "Yes" if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three
>     months.
> -   "Yes" if it completely funds development we'd like to do anyway.
> -   "Yes" if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job.
> -   "Yes" if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts.
>
> Think of it like another form of funding. **Funding is always a
> distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of
> money you get *must be transformative* to the business.** Each of
> those bullet points are transformative, in that each has the potential
> to move your company from "hobby" to "real business."
