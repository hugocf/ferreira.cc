type: text
---

**[Georges Hébert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_H%C3%A9bert)**
(1875-1957) developed the " **Méthode Naturelle** " as a physical
education system [in the early
1900's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3FheeVpFYo) and to create
apparatus and exercises to teach his "Natural Method", composed of
exercises belonging to the 10 fundamental groups:

1.  walking
2.  running
3.  jumping
4.  quadrupedal movement
5.  climbing
6.  equilibrium (balancing)
7.  throwing
8.  lifting
9.  defending
10. swimming

**[Raymond Belle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Belle)**
(1939-1999) closely followed the teachings of **Georges Hébert** 's
"méthode naturelle", learning how best to overcome obstacles fluidly in
a natural environment, to become a renowned firefighter of extraordinary
athleticism and ability, dedicating his life to physical well being:

> ... nothing less than a 'force of nature'

**[David Belle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Belle)** (1973-...),
son of **Raymond Belle** , is credited as the founder of
[Parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour) , a method of training
the human body to become stronger, more agile, and faster, while
remaining efficient and able to move more freely.

**[Sébastien
Foucan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9bastien_Foucan)**
(1974-...), a childhood friend of **David Belle** , is the founder and
creator of
[Freerunning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning#Free_running) , a
relaxed version of Parkour more focused on self-expression and
creativity, as opposed to the speed and efficiency stressed in Parkour.

**[Erwan Le Corre](https://www.facebook.com/ErwanLeCorreMovNat)**
(1971-...), also a friend of **David Belle** , created
[MovNat](http://movnat.com) in 2008 as an actual *training and coaching*
system, inspired by the original " **Méthode Naturelle** " and the
[Paleo lifestyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_lifestyle) .
It's a method of exercise where the practitioner performs a variety of
[complex "natural movements" that use the whole
body](http://movnat.com/about-movnat/the-13-movnat-movement-skills/)
rather than artificially constrained exercises that focus on specific
muscle isolation (e.g. like in most gym equipments).
