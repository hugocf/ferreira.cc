Teen Brain (by [zefrank1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KQb3Mx2WMw&feature=player_embedded))

> Can you do a video on the fact that adults always tell teenagers "I
> know it feels like the end of the world"? Speaking as a teenager, I
> understand that my problems and emotions seem petty and insignificant
> compared to those of full grown adults, but if we are meant to learn
> responsibility and maturity, shouldn't our elder spend less time
> telling us that our problems are small and more time helping us get
> through them?\
> — Michelle

> The severity of feeling is sometimes out of line with the severity of
> the problem.\
> — Ze Frank
