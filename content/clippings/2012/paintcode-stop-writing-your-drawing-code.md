[PaintCode -- Stop writing your drawing
code](http://www.paintcodeapp.com/)

> **The missing bridge between programmers and graphic designers.**
>
> Designing a gorgeous, resolution-independent user interface is hard,
> especially if you have to program your drawing code. PaintCode is a
> simple vector drawing app that instantly generates
> resolution-independent Objective-C drawing code for both Mac OS X and
> iOS.
>
> You no longer have to tweak and recompile your drawing code over and
> over again to achieve the desired result. With PaintCode, a graphic
> designer with no programming experience can draw beautiful controls,
> icons and other user interface elements, and the app automatically
> generates a code that is equally beautiful.
