> This time it's not a pattern in end-user applications, but rather in
> infrastructure services, which I'd call " **Delivery as a Service** ".
> In this model, new offerings provide a set of message delivery
> services for developers that share a few common traits:
>
> -   **Digital services that pre-date the web** , or were designed
>     without the web in mind, can now be exposed as simple web services
> -   **Legacy platforms that require extremely expensive startup
>     costs** convert into a cost-per-message (or cost per thousand
>     messages) model
> -   **Message systems with effective anti-spam components** usually
>     exert a high cost on spammers that can also be a prohibitively
>     high bar for small developers unless they're able to pool their
>     efforts
> -   **Service providers can aggregate requests from many small,
>     separate applications** to make costly services approachable for
>     independent developers
> -   **You can figure out what the hell these service providers do** ,
>     unlike many generic web service providers
