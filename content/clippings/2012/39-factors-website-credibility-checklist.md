[39 Factors: Website Credibility Checklist  | 
ConversionXL](http://conversionxl.com/website-credibility-checklist-factors/)

> Let's say you're walking down the street. A twentie-something dude
> comes up to you -- "hey, are you interested in a new iPhone 5? I'll
> sell it to you for \$20â€³. He pulls it out of his pocket and it looks
> legit. What do you do?
>
> My guess is that you won't buy it -- even through the price is amazing
> and you know it's a good product. Why not? Because of lack of trust.
> Does it work? Is it stolen? What if it breaks the next day? Why so
> cheap? You'll get all these questions in your head and since you don't
> know the guy, you'll probably pass.
