> We do the following on the internet:
>
> 1.  Consume content
> 2.  Communicate
> 3.  Collaborate
> 4.  Produce content
>
> I'd say the breakdown of the amount of each activity is something like
> 80/10/8/2, simplistically speaking (ignoring overlap, etc).

> much so that we produce content as we consume -- tweets, comments,
> facebook 'likes', etc.
