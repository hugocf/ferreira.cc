How to Public Speaking (via [A Show](http://ashow.zefrank.com/episodes/46) with Ze Frank)

> Wear pants. Your own pants!
>
> Take it seriously.
>
> Don't imagine the audience is naked... ðŸ™‚
>
> **I. To think about when creating the talk**
>
> 1.  Don't be a "douchebag".
> 2.  Find a format that is an extension of you... e.g. *Speak about
>     origami in the "style of origami"*
> 3.  Ã˜
> 4.  Write an "honesty talk" with all the things you're affraid and
>     unsure of... it'll often remind you of what you're sure of and to
>     say things **simply and** **honestly** .
> 5.  If you struggle to fin a point... maybe you don't have one. (and
>     it's ok)
>
> **II. Preparing for your talk**
>
> 1.  Don't read!
> 2.  See what excites you in your day-to-day life, and bottle it up to
>     release it on stage.
> 3.  Practice. Do your **entire** talk out loud in an empty room,
>     **without stopping!** (x 3)
>
> **III. When it's time to get on stage**
>
> 1.  It's ok to feel a bit strange, and charged, and afraid, and
>     uncomfortable.
> 2.  Sometimes we confuse **excitement** with **anxiety** .
> 3.  Use your "temperature" before going on stage as your baseline, as
>     what's normal.
> 4.  If don't know how to start, just look out at everyone, smile and
>     say "Hi".
> 5.  Don't pause after you tell a joke.
> 6.  If people start to laugh or clap loudly, start speaking again
>     right after the peak. Think of it as **surfing** .
> 7.  If you make a mistake, don't point it out or dwell on it. Just
>     keep moving.
> 8.  If you see someone in the audience that looks like they hate you
>     to death, avoid looking at them!
> 9.  If you need inspiration, watch a video of [Spalding
>     Gray](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=spalding+gray) .
> 10. **You'll do great!**
