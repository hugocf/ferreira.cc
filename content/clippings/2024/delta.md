[GitHub - dandavison/delta: A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, grep, and blame output](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

> Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.
