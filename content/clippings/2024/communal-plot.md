[The Communal Plot](https://perthirtysix.com/communal-plot-daily-poll)

> This is a daily poll where you can contribute your opinion to a pair of questions. The plot updates in real-time as more people participate. Below the plot, you can dive into some statistics about how your answer compares to the community's.
>
> Once a new daily poll is posted, the previous day's poll is archived. You can still respond to it locally, but other people won't see it.
