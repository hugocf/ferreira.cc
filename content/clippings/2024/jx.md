[GitHub - TwoBitCoders/jx: jx: Memory-Safe JSON Processing using JavaScript implemented in Go](https://github.com/TwoBitCoders/jx)

> Welcome to jx, a powerful command-line tool for JSON processing! â€¦ jx fuses the memory-safety and performance of Go with the flexibility of JavaScript syntax. Unlike other tools like jq that require learning a new domain-specific language, jx allows you to use your existing JavaScript knowledge to handle JSON with ease.
