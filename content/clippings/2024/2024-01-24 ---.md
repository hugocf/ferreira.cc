* Make this into a clipping without copy & pasting (rewrite as bullets or table in my words)

*“i am working on an exercise for my domain to help collectively identify where we have complexity / variance that is not adding value. has anyone every done something like this before?*
*what techniques worked and what didn't?*
*what was the outcome? were you able to act on them to get to a better state?”*

**> I guess what I am getting across is that any method that allows you to map the things you have (applications, services, frameworks, infrastructure etc.) to the needs that they are solving, and the category of that need (differentiating vs commodity etc.) allows you to make judgement calls on whether additional complexity (extensions or customisations to products, or in house developed solutions) is warranted.**
