> **The Ceiling Is Low**
>
> The work capacity of an organization scales, at most, linearly as new members are added. … The ceaseless pursuit of force multipliers is the only possible route to superlinear productivity improvements as an organization grows.

---

> **The Floor Is Lava**
>
> Contention costs grow superlinearly as new members are added. … Staffing highly sequential efforts as if they were entirely parallel leads to catastrophe.

---

> **Hell Is Other People**
>
> Coherence costs grow quadratically as new members are added. … the total time spent communicating will grow quadratically as the work capacity of the organization grows linearly.

> **Principles From Beyond Space And Time**
>
> Keep the work parallel, the groups small, and the resources local
>
> Prioritize the development of force multipliers
>
> If possible, factor work products into independent modules; if not, grow slowly and optimize
>
> Scale organizational efforts across a portfolio of synergistic products
>
> Keep responsibility assignment matrices small, sparse, and local
>
> Prioritize asynchronous information distribution over synchronous
>
> What happens inside the boundaries is important
