[History of Holacracy – Holacracy Foundation](https://www.holacracy.org/blog/history-of-holacracy/)

> GTD seemed to be profoundly “natural” — an inevitable discovery of the most effective way to process, organize, and respond to the world, given the nature of human mind and consciousness. … And so when we finally fully bridged Holacracy and GTD in v3.0 of the Constitution, I was pretty ecstatic.
