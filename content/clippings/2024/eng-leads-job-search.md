> If you do nothing else from this guide, please:
>

> **Communicating Impact**
>
> For each job on your resume, you‚Äôll want one or more bullet points that outline what action you took, what you achieved, the impact it had, and perhaps the tech that was used. The generic format is:
>
> * <span style="color:#00f">{action verb}</span> <span style="color:#90f">{deliverable/achievement}</span> <span style="color:#f90">{impact (quantifiable if possible}}</span> <span style="color:#f00">{tech used (if applicable)}</span>

> **Key Elements for Job Search Microsite**
>
> * Have a professional profile picture
> * Get a clear headline of what you are looking for
> * Have a clear link to both your resume and LinkedIn
> * Tell a story about your strengths and leadership philosophy
> * Highlight the elements that matter most to you and that potential employers will value (your unique value proposition)
> * Pull in recommendations from LinkedIn
> * Showcase multimedia (talks, demos, screenshots, etc.) that would be buried in a resume or LinkedIn

---

> **Behavioral Interviews**

> If you are applying for an engineering leadership position, I recommend using a modified version of the popular [STAR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result)[^1] which I call STAR-F or F-STAR. The added F stands for the ‚ÄúFramework‚Äù that you use to solve the general situation. You‚Äôll help uplevel yourself by showing that you have a framework that you can consistently apply based on your years of experience.

[^1]: ‚ÄúThe situation, task, action, result (STAR) format is a technique used by interviewers to gather all the relevant information about a specific capability that the job requires.‚Äù
