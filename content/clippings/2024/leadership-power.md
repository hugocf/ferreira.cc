> Here is the six-element version of the framework:
>
> 1. **Legitimate power** is inherent in a position, such as a supervisor’s job title. …
> 2. **Reward power** stems from the ability to grant bonuses, raises, promotions, and privileges.
> 3. **Coercive power** relies on the ability to punish via termination, demotion, undesirable scheduling, or unpleasant assignments. …
> 4. **Referent power** is based on our identification with leaders and the intrinsic desire to follow their example.
> 5. **Expert power** stems from our belief that the leader has a deeper understanding of relevant topics and “knows best.”
> 6. **Informational influence/power** goes beyond the expert power by adding an element of learning. … a “socially independent change” which might have been initiated by the leader but continues without the further leadership effort. People may not even remember who was the source of change.
