Nice discussion and good for thought about time, focus, calendars, and meetings culture:

- I used to be "fully on team Leah" for a long time: completely open/transparent calendar (with meeting details, etc.)
- SN made me change to "tentative team Leah": I had to switch my calendar to only show busy/free and block time where I'm not available
- With transparency of labels, people kept crashing my "Lunch" or "Focus work" blocks as if they were not important
- That behaviour almost disappeared in the busy/free only world
- Realised I cannot leave others to judge/define how I use my time
- I find Jason's analogy of "closed calendar + ask me" with the "time is money + we keep our money protected" quite interesting ðŸ¤”
- I instinctively rejected the notion of "closed calendars" at the start but made me think about it by the end
