title: Ask “How?”
subtitle: Transform unactionable goals into concrete actions

Sharing more widely something that came up in a sketching session — a simple **mnemonic** for coming up with **small / recurrent actions** and avoid ending with generic goals that aren’t actionable:

{{< notice tip >}}
**Ask “how?” repeatedly until it it becomes silly** 🙂
{{< /notice >}}

For example, if the initial thing I come up with is…

> *Understand better the inner working of this particular thing*

Asking **“how?”** makes it clear that something is missing; so it becomes…

> *Ask John and Jane about the inner working of this particular thing*

Again, asking **“how?”** still indicates that there’s some room for more detail…

> * Ask John in our next 1-on-1 about the inner working of this particular thing
> * Ping Jane on Slack if there’s any documentation about the inner working of this particular thing

Now asking **“how?”** in any of these two is just silly (they're self-explanatory). So we’re done here. We have now 2 new concrete small actions to take!
