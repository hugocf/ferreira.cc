[The impact of electronic monitoring on employees' job satisfaction, stress, performance, and counterproductive work behavior: A meta-analysis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958822000616)

> Based on our findings, electronic monitoring has a detrimental impact on employees as well as organizations. Employees perceive reduced job satisfaction and increased stress when monitored. On an organizational level, it is likely that there is no gain in employeesâ€™ performance but increased deviant behavior. These results question currently existing justifications for the use of electronic monitoring.
