> **Architect:** Someone who is embedded within multiple teams (within a domain), bringing a combination of deep & broad technical knowledge. Rarely, if ever, commits code that goes to production but may be involved in building prototypes and POCs. Bridges the technical art of designing & documenting solutions and the â€˜softerâ€™ side of navigating client architecture processes to gain buy-in and approval for designs. Some architects bring deep specialisation in a particular area (e.g. security, data, e-commerce) - these are often referred to as Solution Architects.
