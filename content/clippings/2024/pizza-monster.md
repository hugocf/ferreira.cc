title: The strange case of Lisbon Meetups “Pizza Monster”
type: text
---

Remembering the strange case of the [“~~Cookie~~ Pizza Monster”](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22iurie+solomon%22&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) that every Technology [Meetup](https://meetup.com) organiser in [Lisbon](https://www.meetup.com/find/?source=EVENTS&categoryId=546&location=pt--lisbon) became very familiar with during the years around ~2019.

A few nuggets of the outrageous situations surrounding these events, where normal social conventions went out the window:

* 🥇 He was always one of the first to sign up right after a particular Meetup event was open
    - 🤨 Strong suspicion of an automated process going on
* 🍕 Any Meetups that offered complimentary food (usually pizza) were especially targeted 
    - 🤤 Once at the Meetup, he’d ignore all the talks and dash for the pizzas
    - 🥪 The modus operandi was often to fold half of a pizza a couple of times, and process to eat it like a sandwich
    - 🔁 Rinse and repeat until full or no more pizzas
* 🛍️ At one occasion he even brought refrigerator plastic bags to start filling with the available finger food
    - 😤 When called out by the organiser he reluctantly stopped but was quite upset and rude
* 🥷 In another occasion, was caught wandering the private office areas of the company hosting the event
    - 🪧 This despite clear signage indicating the event auditorium

Although difficult situations to deal with at the time, it became an interesting inner-circle joke amongst Meetup organisers in Lisbon.
