>
> It is the throughline of any blog post, essay, or book chapter.

1. The point
2. Setup
3. Reasoning
4. Exploration
5. The point

> Start with the end in mind. What is the point? Write the title and the lede based on that.
>
> Then, the setup. What is the problem? What is have I noticed?
>
> Then, reasoning. Examples. Stories. Structures and frameworks. Subsidiary points.
>
> Then some additional richness. How can you take the idea further? What are the unsuspected consequences?
>
> And finally, the point again â€” but now with more knowledge and perspective, stated in a way that makes it stick.
