TODO: Add a bit of context about each of the principles

1) Work with Your Biology, Not Against It: Understand that different productivity advice works for different people. Listen to your body and find what works best for you, as this may change over time.

2) The Minimal Viable Action: To overcome procrastination, start with the smallest, most manageable action related to your task. Motivation often comes after taking action, so just getting started can help you keep going.

3) You Only Improve What You Measure: Tracking your progress is key to improvement but be cautious about the metrics you choose. They can sometimes lead to focusing on quantity over quality.

4) Don’t Fight Your Emotions; Leverage Them: Optimal productivity comes from working on things you care about. Passion drives you to work harder and overcome obstacles, so try to align your work with your interests.

5) More is Not Always Better: Putting in more hours doesn’t always lead to more output. Beyond a certain point, additional effort can lead to diminishing or even negative returns. It's important to recognize when to stop.
