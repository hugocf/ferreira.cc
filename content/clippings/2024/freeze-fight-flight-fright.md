[Fight or Flight - Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/fight-or-flight)

> **Fight-or-flight** psychology, coined by physiologist Walter Cannon in 1915, is only part of a broader spectrum of acute stress responses. A more accurate sequence we experience may be [freeze, flight, fight, or fright](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318204701619).
>
> **Freeze**: Our immediate reaction to danger might be to "stop, look, listen," remaining hyper-vigilant while we assess the threat, and perhaps hope by not moving, the dinosaur won't spot us.
>
> **Flight**: We may flee the situation to safety.
>
> **Fight**: If escape isn't possible, we might fight back, as shown by the brave individual in the tiger photo.
>
> **Fright**: This might include panic and immobility, playing dead in case a predator decides we're not worth eating after all.
