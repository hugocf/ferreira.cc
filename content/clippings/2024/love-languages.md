[Everyone is wrong about "Love Languages." Here's why. - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/everyone-is-wrong-about-love-languages-heres-why/)

> [Gary] Chapman grouped these types into five distinct “languages.”
>
> * **Words of affirmation**: spoken expressions of appreciation or compliments
> * **Quality time**: spending time together with undivided attention
> * **Acts of service**: doing chores or other tasks for your partner
> * **Physical touch**: ranging from hugs and holding hands to sexual acts
> * **Receiving gifts**
>
> … Individuals can discover theirs by taking a 30-item quiz, [available online](https://5lovelanguages.com/quizzes).

> What [research] has been published, however, is not very supportive.
>
> First off, research contradicts the notion that people have a primary love language, … it instead reveals that they tend to endorse all five love languages as equally meaningful.
>
> Second, the five love languages overly simplify [forms of love](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/where-is-love-felt-bod/) in relationships and are based on a homogenous sample. … couples “who are all married, religious, and mixed gender and likely share traditional values.”
>
> Third … the limited research … does not support the idea that speaking someone’s preferred love language yields greater relationship satisfaction or success.

> Studies consistently show that honest, patient, and clear [communication](https://oscr.umich.edu/article/healthy-relationships-through-communication) is [integral](https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2016/04/11/study_reveals_habits_of_sexually_satisfied_couples.html) to long-lasting and loving relationships. Love languages provide a straightforward way for partners to describe and advocate for their needs. Chapman agrees.
>
> “This is a communication tool that helps couples talk openly and honestly about love in their marriage.”
