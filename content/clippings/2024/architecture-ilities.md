>
> Any list of architecture characteristics will necessarily be an incomplete list; any software may invent important architectural characteristics based on unique factors.
>
> * **Operational Architecture Characteristics**  
>     *… cover capabilities.*
> * **Structural Architecture Characteristics**  
> *  **Cross-Cutting Architecture Characteristics**  
>    *Many architecture characteristics fall outside or defy categorization yet form important design constraints and considerations.*
> *  **ISO definitions**  
>    *The International Organization for Standards (ISO) publishes a [list organized by capabilities](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010).*
