> The LVT follows a Top-Down framework: **Vision** > **Strategic Goals** > **Bets** > **Initiatives**. A company's vision is broken down into a number of strategic goals, which are then defined into a number of bets, out of which value streams and initiatives with specific, targeted outcomes drive achievement from the bottom up.

> *Strategic layer*
>
> 1. **Ambitious Mission** — What is our destination as an organisation?
> 2. **Strategic Goal** — What does the organisation need to achieve to get there?
> 3. **Strategic Bet** — What strategies are we betting to achieve the goal?
>
> *Tactical Initiatives*
>
> 4. **Promise of Value** — What value are we offering to customers to help us do that?
> 5. **Promise of Delivery** — How much are we investing?
