[Rule of Silence definition by The Linux Information Project](https://www.linfo.org/rule_of_silence.html)

> The *rule of silence*, also referred to as the *silence is golden* rule, is an important part of the *Unix philosophy* that states that when a program has nothing surprising, interesting or useful to say, it should say nothing. It means that well-behaved programs should treat their users' attention and concentration as being valuable and thus perform their tasks as unobtrusively as possible. That is, silence in itself is a virtue.
