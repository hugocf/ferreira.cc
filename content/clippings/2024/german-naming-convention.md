[German Naming Convention](https://chrisdone.com/posts/german-naming-convention/)

> Using as many words as necessary to clearly name something. *Everything*.
>
> I called this “German” naming convention as a reference to the fact that the German language is known for its compound words, which can become comically long and specific at times.
