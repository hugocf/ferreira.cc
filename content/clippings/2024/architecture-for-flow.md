> In a world of rapid changes and increasing uncertainties, organisations have to continuously adapt and evolve to remain competitive and excel in the market. In such a dynamic business landscape organisations need to design for adaptability.
>
> Combining different perspectives and techniques from business strategy (Wardley Mapping), software architecture and design (Domain-Driven Design), and team organisation (Team Topologies) provides a powerful toolset to design, build and evolve adaptive systems and team structures for a fast flow of change.
>
This talk illustrates the concepts, connects the dots between these three perspectives, and demonstrates how these techniques help to evolve a legacy system for a fast flow of change.
