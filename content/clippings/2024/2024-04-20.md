> Nobody ever died from the fictional "Covid" disease caused by the non-existing SARS-Cov2. People were dying of the usual causes, but it took the fraudulent PCR test administered in the hospitals to record them as "Covid death".

My sister is a nurse. My in-law as well. Both pulled huge amounts of hours, each in their hospital, on the brink of collapse during emergency care to Covid patients.

My cousin is a lab technician in the Portuguese national health institute and was in the teams doing the numerous blood analysis from most of the 14 Hospitals in the greater Lisbon area.

So I can tell you with all certainty from their 1st hand experiences (based on more details that I can convey on Slack) that the above statement is factually false. That's just not how patient care happened and that's not how lab work is done.

Unfortunately, I cannot write for hours on this subject, so signing off from this thread & channel. 

Wish you all healthy debates üôè
