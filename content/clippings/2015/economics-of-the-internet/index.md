> The idea is that the economics of the Internet work for two types of
> businesses:
>
> -   **Massive businesses** that can take advantage of the Internet's
>     scale to reach a huge number of people very cheaply and
>     efficiently.
> -   **Niche businesses** that can take advantage of the super low
>     costs involved in running an Internet business to reach a very
>     narrow niche of people all over the world very cheaply and
>     efficiently.
>
> (...)
>
> With this audience there are two ways to maximize revenue:
>
> -   You can try to make a **little bit of money from a lot of people**
>     -- this entails getting a little bit of money from everyone on the
>     curve.
> -   You can try to make a **lot of money from a few people** -- this
>     entails maximizing the gain from the people on the left side of
>     the curve.
