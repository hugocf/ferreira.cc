Best comment I've read in a long, long time... It beautifully captures
how I feel with the onslaught of contradictory advice we get from all
over the web.

> Run. Don't run. Walk. It's better. Don't walk in the mornings, there's
> too much smog in the air. Walking in the evenings isn't good for
> digestion and there must be at least a 3 hour gap between walking and
> bedtime. Play. But don't play impact sports. Those would cause
> permanent damage to your knees and joints. Swim. But remember the
> water in most pools are not clean and will lead to skin damage.
>
> In any case, exercise does not really matter. Your diet does.
> Breakfast, like a King, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper.
> That's bullshit. Eat 5 times a day in small equal quantities. No.
> Focus on proteins. Eat white meat, avoid red meat. Eat only fish. Eat
> only chicken. Eat only eggs. make that only the egg white. That's a
> recipe for high cholesterol! Eat only fruits, veggies. Eat only leafy
> veggies. don't eat leafy veggies because they have worm eggs in them.
> Avoid other veggies they have high carbs and lead to gas attacks. Eat
> that ugly looking Brazilian jungle vegetable, it cures cancer. No
> avoid it! it leads to impotence. Stick to fruits but avoid the skin.
> No eat only the skin, they're rich in proteins. But don't eat the
> fruits which have red seeds they are poisonous and green fruits should
> be avoided if they were purple flowers.
>
> Drink milk. But not buffalo milk, drink cows milk. But make it
> skimmed. No skimmed is processed, drink goat milk no camel milk. Don't
> drink milk!the body cannot digest milk after the age of three. Drink
> mother's milk? only till three.
>
> Drink? Water. But not from the tap. Mineral water. Which is tap water
> only dirtier. No only water from the Alps. Drinking is good. Small
> quantity of alcohol helps keep the arteries from clogging. But drink
> only wine. Red wine. but only with white meat. But now since no white
> meat there can't be no wine. Drink only coffee and tea. No they cause
> damage over the long run. Drink green tea. No it causes prostrate
> problems.
>
> Don't smoke! it causes cancer. Smoke cigars less tar. Beedis are
> better. But cause ulcer. Smoking up is best. Pot is bad. It is
> medicine. Yogis smoke up. Yogi's go nowhere. Breathing the air in any
> city is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes.
>
> Welcome to the age of information. You are now better informed about
> every aspect of your health and can take informed decisions about
> leading a healthier, happier and emotionally stable life.
