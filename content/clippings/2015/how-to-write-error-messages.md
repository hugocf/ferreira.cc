> A good error message has three parts:
>
> 1.  **The problem** -- explains that an error has happened;
> 2.  **The cause** -- explains what caused the problem;
> 3.  **The solution** -- explains how to overcome the problem.
>
> After you ensure your message contains all these three parts, its time
> to review it. You need to edit it to ensure it:
>
> 1.  **Is user centred** -- avoid jargon and words your audience will
>     have an hard time understanding;
> 2.  **Is direct** -- as William Strunk said, "Put statements in
>     positive form. Avoid tame, colourless, hesitating and
>     non-committal language";
> 3.  **Omits needless words** -- cut, cut, cut.
