The problem?

Yikes, not a very good prospect at all.

The gist of #noestimates to determine how much scope can be delivered by
a given date:

> 1.  **Select the most important piece of work** you need to do
>     (highest value first)
> 2.  **Break that piece of work down** into risk-neutral chunks of
>     work: (...) small enough that failing to deliver it at first
>     attempt will not jeopardize the project **\[typically \~1 day
>     chunks\]**
> 3.  **Develop** (...) **Deliver** that work to a production-like
>     environment. Work is only done when it is ready to be used by real
>     customers.
> 4.  **Iterate and refactor** : The first implementation can only
>     reflect a first step in understanding what needs to be done.

Be careful to let the system stabilize before it can provide reliable
averages to predict the teams' throughput.

Symptoms of an **unstable system** are:

> 1.   If velocity (# of storiesDone in one sprint) falls outside the
>     control limits more than 3 times in a row ("outside limits")
> 2.  If there are 5 or more velocity points in a sequence (ascending or
>     descending) ("Run test")
