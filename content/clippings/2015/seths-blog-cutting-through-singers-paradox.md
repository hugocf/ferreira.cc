[Seth's Blog: Cutting through Singer's
Paradox](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/12/cutting-through-singers-paradox.html)

Understanding people's motivations for giving and helping out others:

> 1.  **CLOSE & NOW:** (...) Many times, we act generously or heroically
>     because to avoid doing so is to risk being shamed. (...)
> 2.  **GRATITUDE** **:** Even though it might not be at the top of
>     mind, the fact is that once we pull someone out of the pond, we
>     anticipate that they will thank us, and so will the community.
>     (...)
>
> And this is the problem every good cause outside of your current walk
> to work faces. They are trying to solve a difficult problem far away.
> They're working to do something that is neither close nor now. And
> often, because the work is so hard, there's no satisfactory thank you,
> certainly not the thank you of, we're done, you're a hero.
>
> The challenge for real philanthropic growth, then, is to either change
> the culture so our marketing psychology is to donate to things that
> are neither close nor now, and that offer little in the way of thanks,
> or **to create change that hacks our current perceptions of what's
> important.**
