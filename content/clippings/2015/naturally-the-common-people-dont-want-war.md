> Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in
> England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
> understood. But the people can always be brought to the bidding of the
> leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being
> attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and
> exposing the country to danger. **It works the same way in any
> country.**
