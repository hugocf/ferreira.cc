[Michael O. Church's answer to Why do some developers at strong
companies like Google consider Agile development to be nonsense? --
Quora](http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-Google-consider-Agile-development-to-be-nonsense)

> Before I get into why this "Agile" stuff is horrible, let's describe
> where Agile/Scrum can work. **It can work for a time-sensitive and
> critical project of short duration (6 weeks max) that cross-cuts the
> business and has no clear manager** , because it involves people from
> multiple departments. You can call it a "Code Red" or call it a Scrum
> or a "War Room" if you have a physical room for it.
>
> Note that **"Agile" comes from the consulting world. It suits well the
> needs of a small consulting firm** , not yet very well-established,
> that lands one big-ticket project and needs to deliver it quickly,
> despite changing requirements and other potential bad behavior from
> the client. **It works well when you have a relatively homogeneous
> talent level and a staff of generalists** , which might also be true
> for an **emerging web consultancy** .
