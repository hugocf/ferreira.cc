Everybody's reachable. (by [Gary Vaynerchuk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPjqUsFCzxg) )

Interesting left field concept of each business becoming it's own *media
company* focused on a **collateral subject area** their target audience
is interested in, and *not* directly about their core business.

> You're in the " *media business **,** legal services"* ...\
> I'm in the " *media business **,*** *agency/wine"* ...
