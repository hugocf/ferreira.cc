Words](http://eatmywords.com/tips/is-your-name-lame/)

The **SMILE & SCRATCH** test:

> SMILE if your name has these 5 winning qualities:
>
> -   Suggestive -- evokes a positive brand experience
> -   Meaningful -- your customers "get it"
> -   Imagery -- visually evocative to aid in memory
> -   Legs -- lends itself to a theme for extended mileage
> -   Emotional -- resonates with your audience
>
> SCRATCH it if it has any of these 7 deal breakers:
>
> -   Spelling-challenged -- looks like a typo
> -   Copycat -- similar to competitor's names
> -   Restrictive -- limits future growth
> -   Annoying -- hidden meaning, forced
> -   Tame -- flat, descriptive, uninspired
> -   Curse of Knowledge -- only insiders get it
> -   Hard-to-pronounce -- not obvious, unapproachable
