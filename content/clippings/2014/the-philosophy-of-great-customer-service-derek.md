[The philosophy of great customer service  |  Derek
Sivers](http://sivers.org/cs)

> *(Actually, I prefer the term "client care", since "client" implies a
> relationship, instead of "customer", which is transactional. But I'll
> use the normal term instead of confusing things by using mine.)*
>
> 1.  You can afford to be generous
> 2.  The customer is more important than the company
> 3.  Customer service is a profit center
> 4.  Every interaction is your moment to shine
> 5.  Lose every fight
> 6.  Rebelliously right the wrongs of the world
