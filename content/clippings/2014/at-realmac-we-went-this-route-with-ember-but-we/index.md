> At Realmac we went this route with Ember, but we built in a slight
> twist. We try and guide the customer so they can get help or make a
> feature request rather than leaving a review on the App Store that we
> can't respond to. If they are unhappy or confused we want to know
> about it and help them, if they are happy they can let us know and
> perhaps more importantly leave a review.
