> There is, however, old wisdom --- perhaps from an earlier version of

>
> They may optionally include additional detail and/or recovery steps.
> **"Can't x because of y. Something is true. Try a thing."**
>
> A similar form is this: **"Noun can't x because y."** (As in
> "'Downloaded.app' can't be opened because it is from an unidentified
> developer.")
>
> One thing error messages [ never say ]{style="color: #ff0000;"} is [
> sorry ]{style="color: #ff0000;"} . (...)

> Also: they rarely (if ever) use the words [ I, me, my, you, and your
> ]{style="color: #ff0000;"} .
