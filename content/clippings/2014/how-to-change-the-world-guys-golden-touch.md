[How to Change the World: Guy's Golden
Touch](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/guys_golden_tou.html#axzz1thvAkPjO)

> "How can I get people to evangelize my product?"
>
> The short answer is called "Guy's Golden Touch." You might think this
> means, "Whatever Guy touches turns to gold." If only this were true.
> The actual definition is, "Whatever is gold, Guy touches."

> "What are the characteristics of a great product?"
>
> Think: **DICEE**
>
> -    **Deep** . A great product is deep. It doesn't run out of
>     features and functionality after a few weeks of use. (...) As your
>     demands get more sophisticated, you discover that you don't need a
>     different product.
> -   **Indulgent** . A great product is a luxury. It makes you feel
>     special when you buy it. (...) deep down inside you know you've
>     rewarded yourself when you buy a great product.
> -   **Complete** . A great product is more than a physical thing.
>     Documentation counts. Customer service counts. Tech support
>     counts. Consultants, OEMS, third-party developers, and
>     [VARS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_reseller "Value Added Reseller")
>     count. Blogs about it counts. A great product has a great total
>     user experience---sometimes despite the company that produces it.
> -   **Elegant** . A great product has an elegant user interface.
>     Things work the way you'd think they would. A great product
>     doesn't fight you---it enhances you. (...)
> -   **Emotive** . A great product incites you to action. It is so
>     deep, indulgent, complete, and elegant that it compels you to tell
>     other people about it. (...) You're bringing the good news to help
>     others, not yourself.
