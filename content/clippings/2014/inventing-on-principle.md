[Their principles](https://vimeo.com/36579366#t=43m31s)

> [Elizabeth Cady
> Stanton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton) ---
> "Women should vote"
>
> [Larry Tesler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler) --- "No
> person should be trapped in a mode"
>
> [Doug Engelbart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Engelbart) ---
> "Enable mankind to solve solve the world's urgent problems" (a vision
> of "knowledge workers" using complex powerful information tools to
> harness our collective intelligence)
>
> [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) --- "Amplify human

[Your principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366#t=47m38s)

> The world will to make you define yourself by a skill (...) if you
> want to spend your life pursuing excellence and practicing a skill
> (...) that is the **path of the "craftsman"** . That is the most
> common path.
>
> The only other path you'll hear about much is the **path of the
> "problem solver"** . So I see entrepreneurship and academic research
> as kind of two sides of that coin: there's a field, there's a set of
> problems in that field (or needs in the market), you go in, you choose
> one, you work it, you make your contribution there.

[Experience](https://vimeo.com/36579366#t=50m02s)

> It can take time to find to find a principle because finding a
> principle is essentially a form of self discovery (...) where you want
> to stand for as a person.
>
> What I had to do was (...) use all these experiences as ways of
> analysing myself. (...) and saying: "does this resonate with me?",
> "does this repel me?", "do I not care?" (...) and trying to figure out
> why, what is this secret ingredient to all these experiences that I'm
> reacting to so strongly.

[Insight](https://vimeo.com/36579366#t=51m38s)

> If you choose to **follow a principle** ,a principle can't be (...)
> too vague to be directly actionable.
>
> (...) his principle was this specific nugget of insight (...) and that
> is a powerful principle because it gave him a new way of seeing in the
> world, it divides the world in right and wrong in a fairly objective
> way.
