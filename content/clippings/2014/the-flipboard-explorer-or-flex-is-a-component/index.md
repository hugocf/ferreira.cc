> The Flipboard Explorer, or FLEX, is a component that you can easily
> drop into any iOS project. When presented, FLEX shows a debugging
> toolbar that lives in a window above your app. From this toolbar, you
> can view and modify nearly every piece of state in the application.
> Unlike many other debugging tools, FLEX works entirely inside your
> app, so you donÊ¼t need to be connected to LLDB/Xcode or a different
> remote debugging server. It works well in the simulator and on
> physical devices.
