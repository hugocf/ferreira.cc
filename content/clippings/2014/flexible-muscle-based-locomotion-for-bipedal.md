Flexible Muscle-Based Locomotion for Bipedal Creatures (by [John Goatstream](https://vimeo.com/79098420) )

> We present a muscle-based control method for simulated bipeds in which
> both the muscle routing and control parameters are optimized. This
> yields a generic locomotion control method that supports a variety of
> bipedal creatures. All actuation forces are the result of 3D simulated
> muscles, and a model of neural delay is included for all feedback
> paths. As a result, our controllers generate torque patterns that
> incorporate biomechanical constraints. The synthesized controllers
> find different gaits based on target speed, can cope with uneven
> terrain and external perturbations, and can steer to target
> directions.
