[Richard Feynman, the Challenger Disaster, and Software Engineering :
Gustavo
Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/richard-feynman-challenger-disaster-software-engineering)

> With respect to software, I take out four main points:
>
> -    Engineering can only be as good as its relationship with
>     management
> -    Big design up front is foolish
> -    Software has much in common with other engineering disciplines
> -    Reliable systems are built by **rigorously tested** ,
>     **incremental bottom-up engineering** with an **'attitude of
>     highest quality'**
