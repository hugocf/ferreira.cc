[Pairing vs. Code Review: Comparing Developer
Cultures](http://phinze.github.io/2013/12/08/pairing-vs-code-review.html)

> **Prerequisites for success**
>
> There are a few nonnegotiables that are common across both of these
> paradigms.
>
> -    Solid continuous integration
> -   Talented core developers
> -   Agreement on the importance of code quality
> -   Iterative self-organization

> **The joys of pairing**
>
> -   Everybody gets better together
> -   Pairing can balance the natural daily ebbs and flows of energy
> -   A peer generates motivation for self-improvement
> -   Tactical decisions are made more easily and with better results
> -   *\[Stronger\]* concept of collective code ownership
>
> but,
>
> -   Pairing is sensitive to team balance
> -    Pairing culture can breed monoculture
> -    Pairing does not lend itself to hammock problems *\[decisions
>     that require more deep thought or creativity\]*
> -    Sometimes you end up needing code review anyways

> **The joys of code review**
>
> -   Nobody sees your code until you're ready *\[but\]* motivating
>     pressure to perform well is still there
> -   No barriers to taking on deep thought problems *\[allowing\]* for
>     a larger toolbox of problem solving techniques
> -   You are defined by your code *\[which\]* lends itself to a wider
>     pool of personality types
> -   Code reviews are asynchronous
> -   Forces you to think about your values more-so than pairing does
>
> but,
>
> -    Code reviews don't keep you company
> -    Privacy vs self-control: It's all up to you
> -    Code reviews can stack up
> -    "Eh, seems fine to me": (...) likely to be more lenient on code
>     quality
