[Steve Jobs: A Few Memories---Stephen Wolfram
Blog](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-a-few-memories/)

About Steve Jobs' theory on naming stuff:

> I asked Steve why he thought it was good, and he told me his theory
> for a name was to **start from the generic term for something, then
> romanticize it** . His favorite example at the time was Sony's
> Trinitron. Well, it went back and forth for a while. But in the end I
> agreed that, yes, Mathematica was a good name.
