[Propaganda and Marketing -- Are we still persuading? Copywriting by
Copy Hackers](http://copyhackers.com/2014/03/propaganda-and-marketing/)

> Moral of the story: You can create powerful messages using the words
> your prospects use to complete these phrases:
>
> *I want \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*
>
> *I wish someone could \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*
>
> *If only there was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*
>
> And be careful not to veer into "Don't you want...?" territory.

you're defrauding your audience.
