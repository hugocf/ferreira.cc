[How to Steal Killer Sales Copy Straight from Your Prospects'
Mouths](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/steal-killer-copy/)

> What's in these 2 warehouses? Pure copywriting gold.\
> ... Also known as "customer reviews".

> ## Warehouse #1: Amazon Reviews
>
> Most services are tied, in some way, to products. So if you offer a
> service, read the related product reviews, and steal from there. For
> example:
>
> -   If you offer a project management service, mine reviews for books
>     about how to manage projects
> -   If you offer a directory of professionals -- like AnyFu or
>     Sortfolio -- pull from reviews of biographies of the legends in
>     those professions
> -   If you have a deal-of-the-day site, spend a little time on Amazon
>     reviews for every product you host every day
> -   If you're an unknown fashion designer on Etsy, pull from clothing
>     reviews that highlight the things people want when they don't care
>     about big brands and labels
> -   If you're a freelance graphic designer, find new ways to express
>     your value by reading the reviews for Adobe Photoshop and for
>     books on DIY design

> ## Warehouse #2: AppStore Reviews
>
> If you're in the mobile app, digital product or game business, the
> AppStore is loaded with customer reviews that will help you write sick
> copy that resonates with prospects.

> ## What to Look for When You're in a Warehouse
>
> You're trying to find natural phrases and analogies that you will be
> able to use to write actual marketing and sales copy.
>
> (...)
>
> With your selected warehouse open on one monitor, open a Word doc or
> Excel worksheet on another monitor (...) and create a table with 3
> columns. Give the columns these names:
>
> -   Repeated and memorable phrases
> -   What people want *(or things i need to give them)*
> -   What people are mad about or in pain over *(or things i'll
>     eliminate for them)*
>
> Now what?
>
> Now you go through the reviews, one by one, and look for phrases that
> tell you what reviewers were struggling with before buying the product
> and what they wanted (and, in some cases, got) from the product being
> reviewed.
>
> (...)
>
> Here are the top 6 things to consider before copying and pasting
> phrases:
>
> 1.  The more reviewers say X, the more you should consider using X in
>     your copy
> 2.  The more people find a review helpful, the more attention you
>     should pay to the words in that review
> 3.  Phrases that stand out -- whether they're strange, idiotic or
>     funny -- are worth noting
> 4.  Don't try to revise, rephrase, summarize or water-down what people
>     say -- just type it out and figure out if/how to use it later
> 5.  Don't fixate on 1 complaint or 1 praise-phrase
> 6.  Take in a balanced number of favorable and critical reviews

> ## Steer Clear of Expert Reviews and Review Sites
>
> Experts tend to write in cleaned-up, professional-sounding ways.
> That's not what you're going for.
>
> **You want real reviews from real people who've really used the
> product they're reviewing.** (...) people who have:
>
> -   **Experienced a pain** to such a degree that they sought out a
>     cure
> -   **Been convinced** enough to pull out their wallets *(this is a
>     major moment)*
> -   **Spent their hard-earned money** on the so-called cure
