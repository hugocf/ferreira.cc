[Code Like a Chef: Work Clean  |  The Table XI
Blog](http://www.tablexi.com/blog/2012/08/code-like-a-chef-work-clean/developers/)

Interesting concept, specially the part gotten from the [Ad Hoc at
Home](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1579653774) cooking book (by [Thomas
Keller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keller) ), which got me to
dig out for the full text snippet ( **emphasis** added):

> **Being organized -- as we say in our kitchen, working clean -- is a
> skill to develop.** We call it *mise-en-place* , French for,
> literally, 'put in place.' The term can be very specific, referring to
> ingredients needed to complete a recipe, measured out and ready to
> use, or it can be more general: are you organized, do you have
> everything you need to accomplish the task at hand?
>
> **Good organization is all about setting yourself up to succeed.** It
> means getting rid of anything that would interfere with the process of
> making a recipe or preparing an entire meal. If you are in the middle
> of preparation, **you don't want to stop and find the proper pot, or
> dig around** in the cupboard for an ingredient: **that opens you up to
> distractions and errors.** When I'm getting ready to make a dish, I
> make sure everything I need for the entire process is there.
>
> When I peel an onion, I get rid of all the onion skin before I begin
> slicing it. In our kitchens, we keep bowls or pans out for trimmings;
> everything is contained. **When the cooks peel carrots, they do it
> over parchment paper so that they can then crumple up the paper with
> all the peelings and discard it** (or use the peelings for compost). I
> recommend you do the same---use a sheet of newspaper. It saves you
> time and keeps your work space clean. When you finish with a pot, wash
> it. (Notice that in the instructions for the mashed potatoes in page
> 2, one of the steps is to wash the pot you used for cooking the
> potatoes so that you can then finish them in the same pot). **Clean as
> you go to avoid clutter** ; clutter interferes with the cooking
> process. **Things get in your way when you're not organized. Clear
> your path.**
>
> Be organised in your mind too. Think ahead, and think one step at a
> time. Take sixty seconds to write down a list of the tasks you need to
> accomplish so that you don't waste trying to remember what you were
> going to do next. As you're finishing one task, think about what your
> next step will be. When preparing a meal, try to set yourself up from
> beginning to end so that the food that takes the longest is done when
> the shorter-cooking items are ready. I visualize each step of the way,
> almost as if I were taking a picture of it in my mind: how much oil
> should be in the pan as I sautÃ©, how much liquid should be in the pot
> when I'm cooking potatoes, what simmer looks like---anything,
> everything. Try to visualize what you except to see as you move
> through a recipe. Then, if what you see differs from that expectation,
> try to understand why and adjust if possible.
>
> **Being organized is the first and most important part of cooking.**
