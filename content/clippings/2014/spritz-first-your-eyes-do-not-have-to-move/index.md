> First, your eyes do not have to move from word to word or around the
> page that you're reading. In fact, there's no longer a page -- with
> Spritz you only need 13 total characters to show all of your content.

> Fast streaming of text is easier and more comfortable for the reader,
> especially when reading areas become smaller.
