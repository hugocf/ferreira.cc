> 
> Instead, think about dependency direction.
>
> There are two ways you can write HTML and CSS:
>
> ~~"Separation of Concerns"~~ **CSS that depends on HTML.**

>
> Naming your classes based on your content (like .author-bio) treats your HTML as a dependency of your CSS.
>
> …
>
> In this model, your HTML is restyleable, but your CSS is not reusable.
>
> ~~"Mixing Concerns"~~ **HTML that depends on CSS.**

>
> Naming your classes in a content-agnostic way after the repeating patterns in your UI (like .media-card) treats your CSS as a dependency of your HTML.
>
