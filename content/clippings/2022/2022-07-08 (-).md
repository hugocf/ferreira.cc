* Não havia uma analogia ou mnemónica acerca a comparar a importância de revenue, profit, cash flow

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=revenue+profit+%22cash+flow%22+blood+heart+lungs

	1. Revenue = the air that we breathe
	2. Profit = the oxygen your lungs take out of it
	3. Cash flow = blood that takes it to every cell of your body and keeps you alive!
