2022-11-01 team-roles


*(emphasis added)*

> In work, sometimes, we assume that we have the right people around us to do the job. That everyone knows what they are doing. That what they are doing is the right thing in the circumstances. And all of those assumptions, if not tested, can cause huge amounts of friction in the ways in which people work with one another. Because, let’s be honest, **in technology not that many of us work in roles which are as neatly and consistently defined** as the crews that staff aeroplanes, film sets and race car pits.

Good analogy about the usefulness of [“What I Need From You” (WINFY)](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/24-what-i-need-from-you-winfy/) liberating structure and the problem it addressees.
