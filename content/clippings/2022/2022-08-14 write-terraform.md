# 2022-08-14 write-terraform


Good history of the friction between development and operations, and how we got here:

> • Coders and Sysadmins became…
> • Dev and Ops, but silos and slow time to market, so…
> • DevOps, but not practical, so…
> • SRE and Platforms

> … the division between Dev and Ops, and between centralisation and distribution of responsibility has never been resolved.

The key factors that matter to decisive your organisational layout:

> **Factor One: Non-Negotiable Standards**
>
> **If you have standards or practices that must be enforced on teams** for legal, regulatory, or business reasons, then at least some work needs to be done at the centre.

> **Factor Two: Engineer Capability**

>
> **Development teams vary significantly in their willingness** to take on work and responsibilities outside their existing domain of expertise.

> **Factor Three: Management Capability**
>
> While the economic benefits of having a centralised team doing shared work may seem intuitively obvious, **senior management in various businesses are often not able** to understand its value, and manage it as a pure cost centre.

> **Factor Four: Platform Team Capability**
>
> Here we are back to the old fashioned silo problem. **One of the most common complaints about centralised teams is that they fail to deliver what teams actually need**, or do so in a way that they can’t easily consume.

> **Factor Five: Time to Market**
> 
> Another significant factor is **whether it’s important to keep the time to delivery low**.
