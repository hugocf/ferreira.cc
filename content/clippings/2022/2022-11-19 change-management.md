> … change management should be considered a soft skill. It is the ability to combine a vision, strategy, perseverance, empathy, insight into people, cooperation, and goal-oriented work, to achieve *something*.

Steps to make a successful structural change:

> **1. Engage everyone with the change**
>
> Create urgency and make sure everyone knows what is happening and, most importantly, *why* it's happening. Dare to take risks and encourage employees to come up with new ideas and solutions.

Interesting concept about the importance of buy-in to make a change successful.

> Moreover, let all employees vote on whether or not they want to make the change you are proposing and co-creating. If *less* than 80% of the workforce votes in favor for the proposed change, do not even bother thinking about a positive end result.

> **2. Plan change**
>
> * Valid reasons
> * Scope
> * Performance parameters
> * Responsibility

> **3. Implementing the changes**
>
> … make sure everyone knows the reason(s) for change and what is expected of them *and* their team to make the change a reality.

> **4. Make sure the change becomes the new norm**
>
> Change management is not the introduction of a novelty; it is there to create permanent changes in processes or culture.

i.e. continuous improvement and growth mindset as the default behaviours of a group of people.
