Conways law over time

Update 2024-05-28

Context setting:

> Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

> A design effort should be organized according to the need for communication.

> Flexibility of organization is important to effective design.

> — Melvin E. Conway, [How Do Committees Invent?](https://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)

...

> A product you produce today, will effectively have something in it from every org chart your company ever had, it will be in your current design.
>
> — Casey Muratori, [The Only Unbreakable Law](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxMuN_fWDrIL6tneJduyIBrbyRe3KIjfoY?si=LK_hXwHmffRMlWKN)
