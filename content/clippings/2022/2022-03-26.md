> … a great talk by Maggie Appleton about metaphors. In the talk, she explains the difference between a “figurative metaphor” and a “cognitive metaphor”, and references this super interesting book called Metaphors We Live By

**Figurative metaphor**

> … fuzzy misleading stories commonly seen in films, poetry, myth methodology. It's your classic off-the-wall concepts.

**Conceptual or Cognitive metaphor**

> … structures our whole way of thinking about the world … are the basis of almost all human thought.

About the book:

> Their main argument was that we all use metaphor all day every day in normal ways of thinking and interacting with the world - everything we say, perceive, and do is built around a set of metaphorical frames.
