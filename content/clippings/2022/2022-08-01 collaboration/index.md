# 2022-08-01 collaboration

Quite an interesting read about collaboration…

> We found five statistically significant behaviors:
>
> 1. **Co-creation** — Simultaneously working in the same file while bouncing ideas back and forth
> 2. **Rapport** — Building a sense of camaraderie, knowing one another beyond the work
> 3. **Role clarity** — Understanding who needs to be involved in making decisions
> 4. **Feedback** — Comments and discussion on design work that supports iteration
> 5. **Reflection** — Time to discuss what is and isn’t working and make adjustments
