Relevant when there's yet another discussion around the *right* to free speech.


> I think one of two things is true. Either we have unlimited rights or we have no rights at all.

> Personally, I lean towards unlimited rights. I feel, for instance, I have the right to do anything I please. But, if I do something you don't like, I think you have the right to kill me.
