# 2022-06-20 rate-of-change? change-rate? change?


> The Kingman Formula … says that as the utilization approaches 100%, the wait time for new parts entering the system approaches infinity.
* Link to the formula on Wikipedia?

> How do you tune for rate of change? Create sensing loops & planning loops whose duration matches the rate of change in the world. Reduce how much work is being done at a time. Reduce pipelining.
>
> (This is why the response to “Product is interrupting Engineering during sprints” should be “cut the planning cycle in half” & not “forbid interruptions”. Just for example.)
