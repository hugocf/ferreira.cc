> 1. The brain has a limit on its processing horsepower—the more concentration a task requires, the less room it has for anything else. …
> 2. The brain has a limited number of attention channels, and it can only make sense of one sensory signal at a time. …
> 3. … we are perfectly capable of processing multichannel inputs—something scientists call “cross-modal attention.”

Like doodling to increase attention in a conference call:

Multichannel multitasking:

> … you can pair one of those complex tasks with a lower-level task that uses a different sensory input.
