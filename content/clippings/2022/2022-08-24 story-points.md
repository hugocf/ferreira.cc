# 2022-08-24 story-points


> In XP, stories were originally estimated in time … We quickly went to what we called “Ideal Days”, which was informally described as **how long it would take a pair to do it if the bastards would just leave you alone**. We multiplied Ideal Days by a “load factor” to convert to actual implementation time. …: three real days to get an Ideal Day’s work done.
> 
> We spoke of our estimates in days, usually leaving “ideal” out. The result was that our stakeholders were often confused …
>
> So, as I recall it, we started calling our “ideal days” just “points”. So a story would be estimated at three points, which meant it would take about nine days to complete.

> Well, if I did invent story points, I’m probably a little sorry now, but not very sorry. I do think that they are frequently misused and that we can avoid many pitfalls by not using story estimates at all. If they’re not providing great value to your team or company, I’d advise dropping them on the grounds that they are waste. If, on the other hand, you just love them, well, carry on!
