Best ways to speed things up:

• Work on only one thing at a time.
• Work as an ensemble, not as isolated individuals.
• Get all the skills needed to do the work in one place.
• Don't' waste time building things nobody wants/needs.
• Trust people to do their work. 1/2

• Get feedback throughout the dev process.
• Eliminate bureaucracy.
• Test early, test often, automate when possible.
• Create a culture of quality that pervades the org.
• Focus on the system, not on individuals.
