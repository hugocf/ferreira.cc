Nuno Pereira: “How did you do it?”

Hugo Ferreira:
> Basically just ruthlessly pruning of any feature or request that didn’t answer “yes, definitely” to the question “is this mandatory  to start collecting taxes in jan? or can we go live with a manual/alternative process for this and fix it later?”
>
>Context:
> * Team assembled and started working in anger very late-Sep. early-Oct. 2018
> * Hard regulatory deadline of starting to collect VAT by early Jan 2019, i.e. 3 months to work
> * Internal team deadline defined to be running full E2E tests of payment flows by start of Dec. 2019
> * Very motivated and aligned team because everyone wanted to have a quiet and peaceful xmas
>
> For me a key turning point in the project was running a pre-mortem with Neha early Nov. 2018 which helped to get all the concern on the table, surface that many in the team felt the same way and had the same fears, and set fwd concrete actions to focus (both us and the client) around the “prime directive” I referred to above: “is it mandatory to start collecting taxes in jan?”

> According to a Harvard Business Review article from 2007, "unlike a typical critiquing session, in which project team members are asked what *might* go wrong, the **premortem** operates on the assumption that the 'patient' has died, and so asks what *did* go wrong."

> With a different perspective, the activity guides participants to talk about all that could go wrong. Then, the conversation switches to a mitigation and action plan.
