# 2022-12-22 apple-names


> **How Apple Names Things** by _Nicolas Kruchten_ using _Apple trademark data_

Explanation

> • Nodes are name fragments like "i", "phone", "pro", "max" in the name "iPhone Pro Max"
> • An arrow from "i" to "phone" means there is a product name or trademark that contains "i phone" or similar (e.g. "iPhone")
> • Nodes are sized by how many arrows go in or out, and colored by how many arrows go out, from dark blue for few through violet to yellow for lots

* TODO: Grab a screenshot of it?
