About relevant books:

> A few books that initially came to mind on the more general topic of “stuff written for Directors rathern than line managers” were Team Topologies, the later sections of The Manager’s Path, and my own An Elegant Puzzle.

About fostering execution on teams you indirectly manage?

> 1. Understand what’s happening on indirectly managed teams
> 2. Adding things necessary for execution
> 3. Remove things getting in the way of execution

> **What’s actually happening?**
>
> • Business Review Template – these templates … force folks to really analyze what’s happening on their team.
> • Monthly or quarterly roadmap review – what’s actually happening …
> • Skip-levels - … individual contributors and managers have a very different perspective …

> **Adding missing pieces**
>
> • **Strategy** can be unclear, unstated, or unknown.
> • **Urgency** to complete the project. … folks work urgently in areas that leadership says are important, connect to the strategy, and **pay active attention to**.
> • **Cross-functional priority** to complete the project … [and] bypass permission gates …
> • **Capacity to sustain execution** over the course of many projects

> **Remove things getting in the way**
>
> • Excessive visibility / misaligned priorities- … you can help clean that up by being a trusted intermediate
> • Thrashing priorities - … This is more often than not too many, somewhat misaligned, strategies …
> • Fixation on resources - … find a faster, shorter path to solve the problem with the team they have.
> • Weak or negative cross-team or cross-functional relationships - … team isn’t working well with necessary partner teams …
