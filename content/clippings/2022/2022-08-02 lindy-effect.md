[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)

> A theorized phenomenon by which the **future life expectancy** of some non-perishable things, like a technology or an idea, **is proportional to their current age**. Thus, the Lindy effect proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, the longer its remaining life expectancy.
