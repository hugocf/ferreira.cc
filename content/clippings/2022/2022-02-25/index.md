> I like to have **tentative **recurring meetings in my calendar that I *might* attend on occasion (e.g. standup times of other teams) so that I can get any update or cancelation notifications but it’s very annoying that by default they show up as me being “busy” when others are trying to book meetings. I guess “maybe” for me is less of a commitment than it is for Microsoft 😁
