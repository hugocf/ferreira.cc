# 2022-08-02 software-inertia


> So what’s my point? Simply this: **software has inertia**.

> … **quality is more of a sliding scale** than it is a good or bad dichotomy, and I’d argue that many small companies optimize too much in favor of speed by trading away too much in terms of maintainability …

> And this fails the other way too, where major believers in academic-level correctness agonize over details to such a degree that projects never ship, and sometimes never even start.

> As with most things, the answer is somewhere in the middle. Spend time thinking and planning, but not to a degenerate extent – **it’s also important to *****do***.
