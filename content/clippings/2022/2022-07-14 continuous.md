* Make only this about delivery vs deployment and change the slug?

Nice visualisation of the concepts of “continuous integration”, “continuous delivery” and “continuous deployment”

* Find a nice photos that respects Dave Farley concepts and definition

Think of it from the “code” perspective:

1. It is *integrated* with other parts being written
2. It is *delivered* as being ready to potentially release at any moment
3. It is *deployed* live for the users~~
~~

* Link to this clarification from Dave Farley (embed) https://youtu.be/7SNbDWob6cI

	* Quote when he compares delivery with deployment (the latter is a subset of the former; delivery encompasses deployment)

* Link and extract some concepts form here? Continuous Integration vs. Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment - Stack Overflow
	* Kill this? At least ignore what doesn't align with Dave Farley
