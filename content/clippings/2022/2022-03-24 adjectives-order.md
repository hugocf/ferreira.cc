-   Clip the rule for duplicate words
-   Clip the rule for the order of adjectives



<https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160908-the-language-rules-we-know-but-dont-know-we-know>

> Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose


> Reduplication in linguistics ... If there are three words then the order has to go I, A, O. If there are two words then the first is I and the second is either A or O.Â

> The more information[^1] communicated by the adjective, the closer you place it to the noun.


[^1]: i.e. more important/meaningful for that context
