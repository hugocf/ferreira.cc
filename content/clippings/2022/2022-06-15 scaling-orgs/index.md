Advices for scallions organisations. Several “common sense” things, backed by match [HF: match? did I mean science?] 🙂

* Link “common sense” to “common sense is not that common” quote somewhere?

> • It’s really important you learn to delegate effectively and to choose carefully the things that you do get involved in.
> • As the organisation grows, strive to keep the number of stakeholders that need to be involved in any decision down to a minimum
> • You need to keep a strict handle on how many things you’re involved in concurrently; your natural human instinct to be helpful … actually isn’t helpful at all. (Nor is your desire to control / influence everything if you’re wired that way).
> • Working at or close to 100% utilization will slow to a crawl everything that depends on you.
