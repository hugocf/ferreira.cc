Best “no bullshit” tips I've seen about speed reading.

(subvocalisation starts at 4:00)

> If you look at the person who reads aloud the fastest, it's about 600 wpm, it's huge … and when you think about it, what actually limits the limits of oral reading it's really the movements of the mouth, the vocal chords, etc.
> 
> So, it means that inside of your mind you can read much faster.

(summary starts at 19:33)

> **Unlearn slow reading**
> 
> If I am lost in what I read, it's because it's going too slow and my brain is just bored [starts to wander], so… go faster

> **Use a pointer** (finger, pen, chopstick) to help:
> 
> 1. Give the right rhythm
> 2. To avoid going back unnecessarily
> 3. Be able to broaden the scope of few [by pointing ~1 cm after/before the line starts/ends]

> It's a skill, so you **must practice**
