# 2022-09-24 agile


> Agile is a mindset. You do not implement Agile, you become it. But what is “it”? If you ask me, it’s comprised of three primary factors:
> 
> **Continuous Delivery**: A total, all-encompassing drive to regularly and incrementally deliver working software to customers.
>
> **Small, Accountable Teams**: A push for teams to organize into smaller, self-organizing teams who work in small cycles.
>
> **Eliminating Waste**: A neverending focus on reducing top--down hierarchies, needless management, and chafing bureaucracy.
