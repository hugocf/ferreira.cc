# 2022-09-05  models


> All models are wrong, but some are useful.
>
> —  George Box

In more detail (**emphasis** added),

> Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is **how wrong do they have to be to not be useful**.

And also,

> All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly stated, are never exactly true. *All models are wrong, but some models are useful.* So the question you need to ask is not "Is the model true?" (it never is) but **"Is the model good enough for this particular application?"**
