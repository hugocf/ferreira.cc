2022-12-25 exercise


Jocko Willinkâ€™s advice about getting older (**emphasis** added):

> Lift weights, do Jiu-jitsu, go for a run, stretch out, eat good, stop drinking. Pretty straightforward.
>
> **If you don't use it, you're going to lose it!** Every day that you don't do work, you're going backwards.
