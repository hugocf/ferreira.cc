Context: EventStorming is a flexible workshop format for collaborative exploration of complex business domains.
It comes in different flavours, that can be used in different scenarios:
* to assess health of an existing line of business and to discover the most effective areas for improvements;
* to explore the viability of a new startup business model;
* to envision new services, that maximise positive outcomes to every party involved;
* to design clean and maintainable Event-Driven software, to support rapidly evolving businesses.

The adaptive nature of EventStorming allows sophisticated cross-discipline conversation between stakeholders with different backgrounds, delivering a new type of collaboration beyond silo and specialisation boundaries.
