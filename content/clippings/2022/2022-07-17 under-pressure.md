# 2022-07-17 under-pressure


Working under pressure:

> “Do you work well under pressure?” Needs the response “is this job one that regularly engages actual emergencies (e.g. an ER, a fire department) or do you fabricate urgency through poor management, uneven distribution of duties and an inflated sense of self for upper management?”

> “No, I work well with clearly outlined tasks, education → training → practice → experience over time → expertise, constructive criticism, and appropriate boundaries where I don’t have to pretend corporations are ‘families’ and industries are ‘communities.’”
