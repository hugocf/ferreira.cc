Framing tech debt as risk

> A good place to start with this are the typical attributes of quality, but to get you started here are some that we think about at Oakbrook:

>
> • **Security** (a security breach causing financial, reputational or customer detriment)
> • **Data Privacy** (improperly managed data causing internal or external personal data breach)
> • **Resiliency** (lack of resiliency leading to financial, reputational or customer detriment)
> • **Maintainability** (inability to observe, manage and maintain causing financial or customer detriment)
> • **Architecture** (misalignment or miscommunication of target architecture impacting enterprise objectives)
> • **Capability** (inability to meet the demands of the business leading to financial or customer impact)

> To do this we need to change the tech debt story to something less “do a thing” and more “heres a problem”.

TODO: Clip the image “Framing tech debt as risk”

> For example:
>
> - “Implement mutual tls in service x” becomes “communication channel weak security could cause a security breach”
> - “Add tracing to component y” becomes “lack of observability in component y could cause a maintainability or resiliency issue”
> - “Refactor component x to extract class for y” becomes “lack of reusable y could cause decrease in teams productivity”

Then about measuring those risks…

> Right now I’d suggest using a typical model that describes likelihood * impact = risk grade — its pretty well known and senior leaders should have a degree of familiarity with it.

I'm not too keen on all the detailed scoring and see it more as a simple mental ballpark (no numbers) of “likelihood x impact” as a guide for the value it brings. It helps comparing it with everything else we can be spending time on.
