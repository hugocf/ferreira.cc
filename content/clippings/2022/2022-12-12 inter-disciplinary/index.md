2022-12-12 inter-disciplinary
+ multi-disciplinary


> There is another important lesson to be learned from this last fable: the greater the variety of backgrounds of the people who examine a problematic situation, the greater the variety of variables that will be considered as susceptible to control. From this derives the widely observed problem-solving power of interdisciplinary teams.

> The distinction between inter- and multidisciplinary teams is important. When a complex problem is divided into parts each of which is assigned to a different discipline for solution, the result is a multi-, not an interdisciplinary effort. In an interdisciplinary effort representatives of different disciplines work *together* in tackling the undivided problem however complex it is.
