2022-12-04 app-pricing


Print it and frame it a wall:

> No one cares about your financing situation, your business plan, or whether your app is “hand-made” or a mass product.  

Price is elastic:

> In our experience, software pricing is quite elastic. At half the price you sell double. At double the price you sell half. But there are limits. At some point the elasticity breaks.

(**emphasis** added)

> If you cost less, new customers will think that might not be as great and that you have to compete on price.
> …
> If your product costs more but doesn’t perform as well as cheaper competitor products, people will feel taken advantage of. **You need to compare and find the sweet spot.**
