# 2022-06-20 poes-law 

 

> Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, **without a clear indicator of the author's intent, every parody of extreme views can be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression** of the views being parodied.

> Without the voice inflection and body language of personal communication these are easily misinterpreted. A sideways smile, :-), has become widely accepted on the net as an indication that "I'm only kidding". If you submit a satiric item without this symbol, no matter how obvious the satire is to you, do not be surprised if people take it seriously.[^8]
