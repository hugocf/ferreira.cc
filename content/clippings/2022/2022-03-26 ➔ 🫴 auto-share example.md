# 2022-03-26 âž” ðŸ«´ auto-share example
* TODO: This is a real clipping, also used as a share example


* TOTHINK: Do I need `share-blurb`?
* It can be taken from the first sentence, paragraph, or whatever is there until a `<!--more-->` (links and images included, so the `type` frontmatter could be mostly ignored here?)
* It can come from the `summary` frontmatter variable
* Or the first 70 words

* TODO: Clip the keywords in bold?
* TODO: Maybe put them in alphabetical order?

* TOTHINK: Optimise the implementation so that when sharing to multiple channels in the same Slack, the link of the first one is used on the others?

* TOTHINK: Maybe instead of an frontmatter key like `share` (might help with Hugo prepping the posts per destination?) just add a `---\n\nShared to:\n\nâ€¦` that some post processing would then replace with the proper urls:

* ee%tech-community
* ctospt%great-content
* ctospt%diversity-equity-and-inclusion
* sn%diversity
* sn%developers
