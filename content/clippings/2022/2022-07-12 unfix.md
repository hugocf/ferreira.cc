# 2022-07-12 unfix


Interesting library of organisational patterns:

> Team members are mostly dedicated to their _Crew_, but it’s okay if they reserve a small part of their week for work on a _Forum_ (see below).
>
> There are seven kinds of _Crews_:
_Value Stream Crew_ • _Facilitation Crew_ • _Capability Crew_ • _Governance Crew_ • _Platform Crew_ • _Experience Crew_ • _Partnership Crew_
