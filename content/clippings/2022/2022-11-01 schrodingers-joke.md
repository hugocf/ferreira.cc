> A man thinks of a joke. Naturally he thinks it’s funny, but is it? The joke appears to be in an indeterminate state. Only one way to find out for sure. Share it.

> The joke is unchanged, but the state of the observer is different in each case. The joke does not, as such, have a state of “funny” or “unfunny”, and neither does the observer, but as a pair they do. This apparent state is a function of the interaction between the two wave functions.
