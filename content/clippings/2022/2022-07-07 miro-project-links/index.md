```
https://miro.com/app/dashboard/?spaceId=0000000000000000000&projectId=0000000000000000000
```

> 1. First got to your project page where it shows the boards in that project.
> 2. Then open developer tools
> 3. Click on the project name so it brings up the popup to add boards or members
> 4. Check back in developer tools, network tab, look for the api that has “/user-connections?”
> 5. The url in that api will have the account number (spaceId) and the projectId
