> Large, complicated system aren’t controllable when they combine 4 properties:
> 
> * Variability — the environment around the system changes out of control & visibility of the system.
> * Interconnection — the elements in the environment affect each other.
> * State — the system can be in one of many states at any given time.
> * Irreversibility — changes to the system, once made, cannot easily be unmade.

> Software development has all 4 properties. [XP, in this model, works by introducing reversibility to software development decisions](https://www.facebook.com/notes/681695435785808/).
