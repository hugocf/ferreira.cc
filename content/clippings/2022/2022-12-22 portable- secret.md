2022-12-22 portable- secret


> Portable Secret is a little hack that allows you to:
>
> • Send encrypted messages/images/files over insecure channels (email, messaging, …)
> • Store sensitive information (passwords, documents) in insecure locations (web, Cloud drives, USB drives)
>
> It’s portable because: **decrypting these secrets does not require special software!** All you need is a browser.
