* Clip bit about peer review not existing in the time of Einstein
	* ~~Maybe the same that Paul did?~~

	* Not about ego but about the history of how it came about

> I think we had the wrong model of how science works. We treated science like it’s a _weak-link problem_ where progress depends on the quality of our *worst* work. If you believe in weak-link science, you think it’s very important to stamp out untrue ideas—ideally, prevent them from being published in the first place. You don’t mind if you whack a few good ideas in the process, because it’s so important to bury the bad stuff.

> But science is a strong-link problem: progress depends on the quality of our *best* work. Better ideas don’t always triumph immediately, but they do triumph eventually, because they’re more useful. … We didn’t need a scientific establishment to smother the wrong ideas. We needed it to let new ideas challenge old ones, and time did the rest.
