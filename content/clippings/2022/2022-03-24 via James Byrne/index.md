> **Ten Commandments of War Propaganda**
>
> 1. We do not want war.
> 2. The opposite party alone is guilty of war.
> 3. The enemy is the face of the devil.
> 4. We defend a noble cause, not our own interest.
> 5. The enemy systematically commits cruelties; our mishaps
are involuntary.
> 6. The enemy uses forbidden weapons,
> 7. We suffer small losses, those of the enemy are enormous.
> 8. Artists and intellectuals back our cause.
> 9. Our cause is sacred
> 10. All who doubt our propaganda, are traitors.
