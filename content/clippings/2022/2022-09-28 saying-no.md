> A good &quotno" needs to have empathy, honesty, alternatives and re-assurance, and having the following structure helps me be consistent with them:
>
> 1. Empathy - to confirm I acknowledge that the ask is heard and is important
>
> 2. Rationale - to be transparent why I cannot act on this request
>
> 3. Temporality - to be PRECISE about how long before I can act on it
>
> 4. Alternative - to unblock the requestor if there exists a workaround I can offer
