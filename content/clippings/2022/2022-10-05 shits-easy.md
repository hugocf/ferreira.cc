2022-10-05 shits-easy


Shit’s easy if you don’t have to implement it.

> “Shit's Easy Syndrome”
> 
> You know. As in, shit's easy. If it's easy to imagine, then it's easy to implement.

> Shit is NOT easy. Remember that. Shit is NOT easy. If you think it's easy, then you are being naïve. You are being a future VP. Don't be that way.

> Moral of the story: Shit is not easy. Stuff takes time. Months. Years. Decades. It's OK! You'll still be here. Count your calories. Exercise. And you'll still be here to see it all happen.
