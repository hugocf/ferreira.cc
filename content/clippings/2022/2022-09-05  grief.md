Five stages of grief:

1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

It is known that [all models are wrong](models.md) and, as usual, this one has several criticisms:

> * The existence of these stages as such has not been demonstrated.
> * No evidence has been presented that people actually do move from Stage 1 through Stage 5.
> * The limitations of the method have not been acknowledged.
> * The line is blurred between description and prescription.
> * The resources, pressures, and characteristics of the immediate environment, which can make a tremendous difference, are not taken into account.
