# 2022-06-07 http


New HTTP RFCs

> That led us to rearrange HTTP into three documents:
>
> - [HTTP Semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110) - those core, versionless semantics
> - [HTTP Caching](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111) - split into a separate document for convenience, but also versionless
> - [HTTP/1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112) - everything thatâ€™s specific to that textual wire protocol
>
> The revision of HTTP/2 and the brand-new HTTP/3 (based upon QUIC) are being simultaneously published and both rely upon the first two documents.

Also,

> HTTP field names now have their own registry to make them easier to track down.
