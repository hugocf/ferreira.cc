> Let’s examine a 50,000-word book, which is typical these days … A hardback typically has 250 words per page, so that’s 200 pages …
>
> Breaking that down into content types, you might get the following:
> 
> • **Ideas and frameworks:** 8%. 6,000 words or 24 pages.
> • **Stories (case studies and examples):** 35%. 17,500 words, or 70 pages.
> • **Proof points (data, quotes, citations):** 20%. 10,000 words or 40 pages.
> • **Argumentation (reasoning):** 15%. 7,500 words or 30 pages.
> • **Advice, how-tos:** 18%. 9,000 words or 36 pages.

> Preparation, research, idea refinement, and discipline are the real challenge.
