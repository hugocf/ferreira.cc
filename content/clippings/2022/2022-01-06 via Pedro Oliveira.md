> **Mentoring, coaching, or sponsoring?**
>
> Mentoring and coaching *activities*** look similar, but the *impetus* is different. In mentoring relationships, usually the mentee sets the agenda. In a coaching relationship, usually the coach sets the agenda. â€¦
>
> Sponsorship is very different. A sponsor uses their authority and influence to create opportunities and recognition to advance someoneâ€™s career.
>
> Depending on the context, a mentor might also act as a coach or sponsor.

> One way to think about the distinction is whether there are direct consequences to following or ignoring advice. **Mentors advise; coaches assess.**

> Mentors should operate at three levels.
>
> â€¢ Goals - figuring out what they really want
> â€¢ Situations - handling the unfamiliar or difficult
> â€¢ Skills - getting promoted

> To mentor goals, ask questions. ğŸ”—

> To mentor situations, tell stories. ğŸ”—

> To mentor skills, observe them in action. ğŸ”—
