# 2022-03-28 1meeting? one-meeting?


“One meeting to rule them all”

Here's a strange and interesting concept for distributed teams 🤔 

> What does this “meandering team sync” look like? For my team at Honeycomb, our meetings are **an hour a day, five days a week**.

> **Finally, it actually reduces meetings and interruptions for the team.** When we have a team retro, we do it during the sync. Weekly, monthly, quarterly planning—it all happens during the sync. Need to coordinate with someone from another team? Invite them to the sync.
