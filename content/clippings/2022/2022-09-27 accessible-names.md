# 2022-09-27 accessible-names


> I wrote about _why accessible names matter and where to add them_ before. In this post, I will go into how to make the actual names more user friendly. These tips are all from an underappreciated piece of content that I love: the _Composing Effective and User-Friendly Accessible Names section_ of the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide. All credits go to the authors, I'm just adding context and examples.

> * Function over form
> * Most unique part first
> * Be concise
> * No roles as part of the name
> * Keep names unique
> * Sentences aren't names
