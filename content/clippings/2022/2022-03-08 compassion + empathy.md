**## 2022-03-08 compassion + empathy**

* Make this into several clippings with slugs for each word
	* empathy
	* compassion
* inc. the definitions from Tania Singer

### SA-IL weekly session
*Katherine Kirk*

* In SA-IL, we always *monitor*

* What is the difference between SA-IL Monitoring and the usual monitoring and measuring?
	* *Hannah Sheppard: In SA-IL you expect it to go up and down whereas usually you would want it to go in one direction*
	* *Hugo Ferreira: usual monitoring and measuring is just data without context?*
	* *Fahad Nari: In SA-IL monitoring can be a bit like introspection [contemplation] but in usual day 2 day monitoring you know what you are looking for*
	* **We monitor for patterns and themes/trends over time in context  - WITH COMPASSION (contextual sensitivity)**

* Compassion is not empathy
	* *Empathy — It stays between 2 people, one identifying with the others feelings*
	* *Compassion — Takes it a step up and considers the context*

	* There‘s a lot confusion between the 2 everywhere
	* In SA-IL we use the definitions of Tania Singer on how to care about others without stopping to be inspired

2023-04-11 Update/recalled in the context of my post on receiving feedback

	* Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout | WIRED UK

		* *Compassion is a feeling of pity or a warm, caring emotion that does not involve feeling, say, sadness if the other person is sad*

	* Empathy and compassion - PubMed

		* *Empathy makes it possible to resonate with others' positive and negative feelings alike*
		* *If this self-other distinction is not present, we speak of emotion contagion, a precursor of empathy that is already present in babies*

	* Dr. Tania Singer
