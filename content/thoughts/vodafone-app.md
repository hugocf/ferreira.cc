title: Vodafone “Update” app for iPhone
---

A while back, [Widgetlabs](http://www.widgetlabs.eu) (makers of [Vodafone's **Update** app for iPhone](http://www.vodafone-update.de/iPhone)) was kind enough to [ask about my complaints](http://twitter.com/Widgetlabs/status/6922819882) regarding the Vodafone **Update** app.

Having setup version 2.0 of the app to connect to my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hugocf), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/hugocf) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hugocf) accounts, here's a quick list of my main impressions, in no particular order:

**Problems**

- Poor timeline management, with several issues:
    - Entries getting frequently out of chronological order, with the most recent ones appended after 1 month old entries, for example.
    - Getting thrown to the top of the timeline when returning from the details of an item, instead of staying where we left off.
    - Different update speeds per network give the impression that no updates exist for a certain period of time, only to have it "magically" appear after you've already scrolled past that point.

        *These issues showed up more often when coming back to the timeline from the details of an old update, reached after scrolling back "in time" (e.g. to 1 month old entries).*

- Date & time formats do not follow the regional format settings. *(AM/PM? Please!)*
- On Facebook updates, content shared without a custom comment appear as *"no text posted"* making it impossible to discern from the timeline what it is about.

**Annoyances**

- Can't go to the next/previous update when in details mode! Having to get back to the timeline only to check the next item is very cumbersome. *(not to mention when the problems with the timeline quick in, as mentioned above)*
- On Twitter, there is no easy way to see a user's mentions from the
    user's profile. *(only option is to do a manual search?)*
- The app supports multiple networks but not multiple accounts for the same network?!? *(this is just bizarre and, in my opinion, shortsighted!)*
- We can only see the user's profile on Twitter?! What about the other networks?
- On Facebook, updates from apps appear without identifying which "friend" posted them.

**Improvements? Nice to have?**

- Add a way to see a user's favorites on Twitter.
- Add the ability to hide app notices from the timeline on Facebook.
- Twitter profile counts (followers, following, etc) should be clickable to see a detailed list.
- Allow to flag/star/favorite directly from the timeline. *(relates to my personal usage, since I often "flag for later" to check back when I have more time)*
- When starting the app, go back to where the user left off. *(very useful for when incoming phone calls come in)*

These are only the main ones I've noticed after a couple hours of using the app but bear in mind that with both Facebook and Linkedin having their own iPhone applications and Tweetie being the best-seller app for Twitter, the expectations for accessing these networks through an app are quite high!
