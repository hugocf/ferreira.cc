title: Working from ~~Home~~ Hell
summary: "After 15 days of confinement due to COVID-19, with 2 adults working and 3 children attending school remotely, “WFH” is standing more closely to “Working from **Hell**” than “Working from *Home*”. 😱"

Let me give you a sneak peak of my past 15 days in COVID-19 induced confinement, “working from home”. 👀

Yesterday I kept a pen and paper always by my side and noted the times of what happened during the day. ✍️

In summary, got some focused periods here and there 👨‍💻 but the interruptions ❌ are killing me slowly. Handling them can take anywhere from 2 to 20 mins.

To be honest, this was a pretty typical day, similar to most other lockdown days. Not exaggerating at all, unfortunately. 😩

>  **Repeat after me**: This has *nothing* to do with working remotely!
