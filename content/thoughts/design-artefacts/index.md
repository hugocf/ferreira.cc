title: UI/UX design artefacts
subtitle: Comparison of sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype
summary: Compare and contrast different design artefacts (sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype) in terms of their fidelity, speed, cost and use cases.

Because this seems to keep popping up in my discussions from time to time:

| Artefacts | Fidelity | Speed | Cost |
| --------- | -------- | ----- | ---- |
| Sketch    | âž–âž– *very low* | âž•âž• *very fast* | ðŸ’² *cheap* |
| Wireframe | âž– *low* | âž• *fast* | ðŸ’²ðŸ’² *low* |
| Mockup    | âž• *medium* | âž– *slow* | ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’² *high* |
| Prototype | âž•âž• *high* | âž–âž– *very slow* | ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’² *expensive* |

**Sketch** â€”Â pen & paper rough drawings

- Quick brainstorm of *ideias*
- Easy communication of purpose

**Wireframe** â€”Â black & grey representation

- Use: quick communication of *interactions*
- Documenting the interface; 

**Mockup** â€” static coloured visualisation

- Gather rough feedback and buy-in from stakeholders

**Prototype** â€” real interactive implementation

- User testing in a scenario close to reality
- Possibly reusable into the product
