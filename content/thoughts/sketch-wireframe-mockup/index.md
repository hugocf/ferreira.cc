title: Sketch, Wireframe, Mockup, Prototype
summary: Compare and contrast different design tools in terms of their fidelity, time, cost and use cases.

Because this seems to keep popping up in my discussions from time to time:

**1. Sketch**

-   Fidelity: **– –** (very low)
-   Time: **++** (very fast)
-   Cost: **¢** (cheap)
-   Use: quick **brainstorm** of ideias; **easy communication** of
    purpose; pen & paper rough drawings

**2. Wireframe**

-   Fidelity: **–** (low)
-   Time: **+** (fast)
-   Cost: **$** (low)
-   Use: **quick communication** of interactions; **documenting** the
    interface; black & grey representation

**3. Mockup**

-   Fidelity: **+ / ++** (medium / high)
-   Time: **–** (slow)
-   Cost: **$$** (high)
-   Use: gather **feedback** and **buy-in** from stakeholders;
    static visualisation

**4. Prototype**

-   Fidelity: **+ / ++** (medium / high)
-   Time: **– –** (very slow)
-   Cost: **$$$** (expensive)
-   Use: user **testing**; possibly **reusable** into the product; real
    interactive implementation
