title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“going crazy”** 🤪

* New family member arrived: 2.5 month puppy, making the children ecstatic and giving us flashbacks of raising a “baby” again 😱
* Working to find the proper balance between supporting the team and contributing vs organising. [StaffEng](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes) is casting an interesting perspective on it 🤔
* Enjoying remote work immensely. Not my first rodeo working remotely but *for me, in this area,* the pandemic was a blessing in disguise 👨‍💻
