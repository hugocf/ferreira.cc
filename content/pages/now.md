In a word: **“writing”**

* Finally managed to “hack” my brain (with self-inflicted peer pressure) into dusting off the dozens of rough drafts accumulating in my “virtual” drawer over the years 😅
    - Started posting with some regularity in my [Hugo Ferreira – Medium](https://hugocf.medium.com) account
    - Reviving this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) into something that is easy for me to update
* Revamping some communication patterns and trying to instil a better documentation culture at work, heavily inspired by the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
