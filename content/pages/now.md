In a word: **soul searching**

* Still following up from the new year induced self-reflection musings and the big 5-Oh fast approaching
* Revisiting old assumptions about personal organisation, interiorising that reality is chaotic and we must:
    - “Ride the waves” instead of “trying to control the ocean”
    - “Start by scaffolding” instead of “doing the whole building”
    - “Say it’s not a priority” instead of “I don’t have time”
