title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“settling”**

* Back to [Equal Experts](http://equalexperts.com/) Portuguese office after a few months at [HMRC](http://equalexperts.com/) in London, UK.
* Exciting times at work: Starting to define what the Portuguese branch will be, were we want it to grow, and how can we get it there.
* Resuming day-to-day family life after months of work traveling: only now realising how much I missed the chit-chat with the kids at dinner table. 😀
