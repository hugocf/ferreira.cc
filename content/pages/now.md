title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“settling”**

* Back to [Equal Experts](http://equalexperts.com/) Portuguese office after a few months at [HMRC](http://equalexperts.com/) in London, UK.
* Exciting times at work: starting to define what the Portuguese branch will be, were we want it to grow, and how can we get it there. A bit of the “startup” feeling (= PT) but in a company with an already great culture (= UK).
* Started <del>reading</del> studying [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653): a very hands-on book that can’t just be “read”, it needs to be “worked on”.
* Resuming day-to-day family life after months of work traveling: only now realising how much I missed the chit-chat with the kids at dinner table. 😀
* Started practicing [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](http://vitateambjj.com/) together with my kids; it’s been great for our father-son family dynamics. Very pleasantly surprised by how close BJJ is to many of the [natural movement](https://www.movnat.com/) principles I’ve been looking into for quite some time.
