title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“cruising”** 🙂

* Great work environment at [Equal Experts](http://equalexperts.com/) Portuguese office, with cool people all around.
* Diving into the whirlwind world of [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) and a doing more *devopsy* sort of tasks.
* Scala still giving lots of challenges and my first choice to be production in the *very little* personal time left to play around with coding (had to shelve <del>Haskell</del> and <del>[Reactive](http://reactivex.io/)</del> <del>[Programming](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)</del> for a later time).
* Personal and family life feel the most balanced they've been in years! Hat-tip 🎩 to Experts Experts for the pervasive culture of sane work-life balance.
* Getting back into [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](http://vitateambjj.com/) after 1~2 months off due to a “light” injury; *(sigh)* it feels like starting from scratch all over again… still lots of fun though 🙂
