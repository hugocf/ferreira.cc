title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“refocusing”**

* Shifting my role form a team Tech Lead perspective into a still “to be defined” mix of Architect/Solver (see [Staff engineer archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes))
* Getting back to consistent and foundational daily routines to give some structured to otherwise quite chaotic days
