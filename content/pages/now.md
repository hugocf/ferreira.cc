In a word: **preparing**

* Settling expectations of _what it is_ to be an “engineering manager” based on what’s really needed by my current context (i.e. more of a “manager of engineers” rather than an “engineer who manages”)
* Gearing up for the turmoil that is the “holiday season”, where routines and balance then to go out the window
* Exploring [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) as a way to revive the [Clippings](https://hugo.ferreira.cc/clippings/) section
* Currently reading: nothing (using my “walk the dog” time for letting thoughts run free rather than concentrating in any audiobook)
