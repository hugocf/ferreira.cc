title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“focusing”**

* After half a year focusing a bit away from Scala and more into Kubernetes, i’m preparing for a series of talks this year about the work done last year on [UX Forms](http://uxforms.com/).
* Focusing on family life, home improvements, and the kids… *(need to prepare for those pre-teen years asap* 🙂*)*
* Betting fully on [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](http://vitateambjj.com/) as the way to get physical and mental health out of the sedentary and stressful day-to-day life.
