title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“settling”**

* Currently working at [Equal Experts](http://equalexperts.com/) in the UK’s [HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/) and commuting to London during week days.
* Getting to know the teams as EE and loving every minute of it! 😉
* London feels now very familiar and comfortable. It’s a awesome city!
* Moved with the family to a new apartment end of last year, and it’s now starting to feel like home. 🙂
