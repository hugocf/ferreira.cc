title: What I'm doing now…
---

In a word: **“cruising”** 🙂

* Great work environment at [Equal Experts](http://equalexperts.com/) Portuguese office, with cool people all around.
* Started to learn and code in a [Reactive](http://reactivex.io/) [Programming](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) style.
* Getting ready for the 2nd phase of Functional Programming immersion: learning Haskell.
* Personal and family life feel the most balanced they’ve been in years! Hat-tip 🎩 to Experts Experts for the pervasive culture of sane work-life balance.
* 1 year [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](http://vitateambjj.com/) anniversary last month: feels like it was just weeks before that I started, together with my kids. Time flies. Some much to learn. So much fun doing it.
